# <center>3 - Riding The Marlow</center>

## Overview

The Marlow is an elemental-powered riverboat, one of the only such ships in use at Stormreach. Chinxero is a privateer, with no connection to any of the dragonmarked houses, although he works for many of them from time to time. The Marlow has a complement of ten sailors.

Once all preparations are made, Captain Chinxero pushes off. The characters are forced to share a small auxiliary cargo hold for their quarters—space is at a premium. 

 

The river is wide and broad, and the elementalpowered riverboat can cover about eighty miles a day. Each night, Captain Chinxero drops anchor in the middle of the river and sets a watch (the PCs are free to set their own watch, as well). [[The Marlow]]’s speed and the distance they must travel means that the characters will spend approximately five days on the cramped riverboat. Read or paraphrase the following description of the trip once the boat passes the lightly populated portion of the river and enters the deep jungle.

Caimans, river otters, and fish of various sizes swim through the water ahead, beside, and behind the Marlow, while hundreds of different species of birds are visible and audible in and around the surrounding jungle. Every so often, a crew member points out an exotic animal eyeing the passing boat from the safety of the jungle foliage. Only the path that the river cuts through the emerald trees and foliage is clear—all else is a riot of leaves, branches, and strange animals. Occasionally, the distant sound of drums can be heard, drifting over the canopy of leaves.

If asked about the drums, Chinxero shrugs and says, “It would be diffi cult to number the different savage tribes and races that hunt through the jungle. We’d best stay clear of them, though—it is well known that most eat humans and halfl ings if they can catch them.”
