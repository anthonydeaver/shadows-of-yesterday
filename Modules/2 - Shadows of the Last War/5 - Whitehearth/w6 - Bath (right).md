## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

A 10-foot-long pool of cool, clear water occupies the fi rst chamber, and a row of marble latrines is set against the walls in the far chamber. The living fl aming sphere refuses to enter the bath area, so the PCs can dive into the pool or otherwise retreat to relative safety in this room. If the PCs search the far chamber, they discover a partially charred human corpse in a robe propped against the wall next to one of the latrines. As with all corpses in the Mournland, this one appears freshly killed, even though she must have died four years earlier.

Every 24 hours, the pool is magically purifi ed and refi lled. The corpse is the body of a wizard researcher.

## Rewards

The corpse wears a belt pouch containing 5 sp, 3 gp, and a brown keycharm. She wears an arcane signet ring bearing the House Cannith seal.
