## Overview

**Scene Type**: Interaction

**Setting**: Outdoors

**Encounter Type**: Roleplaying

If the PCs weren’t able to board Cloud’s Destiny before it departed for the docking tower, use this encounter to get them back on Lucan’s trail. Right after Cloud’s Destiny leaves its berth, the PCs must contend with the dominated gnomes who serve as Lucan’s minions. The gnomes (see “Final Boarding Call”) fi ght until they are incapacitated or killed, or until the PCs leave Docking Berth 3.

This encounter provides the PCs with another mode of transportation in the form of a privateer airship called Jade’s Fury. While the vessel might look like an innocuous, privately owned airship, it is really disguised and in the service of the Order of the Emerald Claw. This fanatical organization, bent on increasing its power through magic and eventually dominating the world, wants to capture Lucan and the soul blade for its own nefarious purposes. The Order of the Emerald Claw takes great pains to maintain secrecy, so the PCs should not be able to easily or quickly see through the disguise. As the PCs finish the battle with Lucan’s minions, a privateer airship slides up to the docking tower. Read:

Suddenly an elemental airship rises from below the docking berth to hover alongside the platform. At first, it looks as though Cloud’s Destiny has returned. Then you notice that this airship has massive gouges along its hull, a hole near the stern, and a broken shaft at the tip of the prow. Faded paint along the bow proclaims that this vessel’s name is Jade’s Fury. A thin, disheveled half-elf appears at the side and tosses a rope to you. “If you want to catch that ship, climb aboard!” he calls.

## Rewards

About twenty-fi ve hours into the journey, as the airship passes the eastern cliffs of the Howling Peaks, Garrow orders an increase to battle speed, and Jade’s Fury closes on Cloud’s Destiny. He then orders the PCs to get into the small skiff he has moored to the prow of his airship. It has a crew of two, in addition to space for the PCs. “Get in,” Garrow shouts. “They’ll take you over to Cloud’s Destiny.” 

 

“Captain Rarwog” is true to his word. His men fl y the PCs over to the other airship, pulling low and alongside it so as not to attract the attention of its crew. One of the men tosses a grapple and line that catches on the deck. “Climb,” he says, offering the PCs a way to get aboard Cloud’s Destiny. Since it is dark and few of the House Lyrandar crew are on deck, the PCs can quietly slip aboard. That’s when the next big scene begins. Go to “Sky Raiders to Starboard!”

## Background

A half-elf who calls himself Captain Rarwog is the owner and operator of Jade’s Fury. In reality, he’s the changeling named Garrow, a commander in the Order of the Emerald Claw. His disguise is fl awless, especially since the last time the PCs met Garrow (if you ran Shadows of the Last War) they saw him in his vampire disguise. See the Appendix for Garrow’s statistics. 

 

The PCs have a simple choice here. They can accept aid from the privateer, or they can ignore him and fi gure out their own way to follow Lucan. Garrow, for his part, wants the PCs to accompany him. That way, he gets to try to fi nd out what they know about his two current projects for his masters in the Emerald Claw—his search for the House Cannith schemas and his hunt to capture Lucan and the soul blade. 

 

Obviously, the plot demands that the PCs resume their tracking of Lucan. Garrow is willing to help them in this in order to promote his own agenda. If the PCs refuse, they have to fi nd their own method of transportation. In that case, pick up the adventure when they come upon the Cloud’s Destiny crash site near Sterngate.

 

If they do accept “Captain Rarwog’s” offer, the PCs climb aboard a ship that looks pretty much like a beatup, less cared for version of Cloud’s Destiny. Instead of a fi re elemental bound to the ship to provide power, Jade’s Fury uses an air elemental. 

 

Garrow and his crew appear to be a band of ragtag privateers, similar to a dozen or more such groups that operate on the fringes of society. There are no other passengers on board. The crew won’t engage the PCs in conversation, and even “Captain Rarwog” remains aloof and distant for much of the trip. They won’t do anything to let their disguises slip or their true identities be revealed.

Garrow’s Story: In the guise of Captain Rarwog, a half-elf scoundrel with a bad sense of humor and an adventurer’s disposition, Garrow explains that he has been sent by Ambassador Neya ir’Krell to aid the PCs. “The good ambassador had a change of heart,” Garrow tells them. “She was afraid you wouldn’t get aboard Cloud’s Destiny in time, and it appears she was correct. So me and my crew are here to give you a lift. Hop aboard and don’t touch anything.” 

 

This is all a lie, of course. Neya has no connection to Garrow or his Rarwog persona. But this is a story that Garrow believes the PCs might accept, so he sells it with all the gusto he can manage.

A few hours into the trip, when Jade’s Fury gets close enough to see Cloud’s Destiny in the distance, Garrow once again engages the PCs in conversation. He wants to see what he can get them to tell him about their connection to House Cannith and Lady Elaydren, the schemas they recovered and where they are at the moment, and then whatever he can get them to reveal about Lucan and the soul blade. Garrow is cagey and very smart. He attempts to learn these things by asking innocent questions and showing a genuine interest in the exploits the PCs have engaged in. If they become hostile or suspicious, he apologizes and excuses himself. “I do have an airship to fl y,” he says with a lopsided grin.
