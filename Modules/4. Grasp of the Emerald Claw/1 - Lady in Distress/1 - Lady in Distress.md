# <center>1 - Lady in Distress</center>

## Overview

This adventure begins in the city of Sharn. If you ran Whispers of the Vampire’s Blade, it takes place a couple of weeks after the adventurers return to Sharn to report to Viorr Maelak of the King’s Citadel. If you are starting with this adventure, the references to past events happened to Lady Elaydren and a previous group of adventurers under her employ. She serves as patron for a number of groups, however, including the group participating in this adventure. 

 

Part One gets the adventure rolling by providing the group with a call to action from one of their patrons, Lady Elaydren of House Cannith. At the Lady’s domicile in the Middle-City, the adventurers must overcome a trio of Karrnathi zombies to get to their patron’s side.
