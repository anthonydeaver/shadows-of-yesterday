## Overview

**Scene Type**: Interaction

A stone staircase takes the PCs to the top of the tower. The upper room is an enclosed greenhouse. A glass ceiling lets in light, while a moist, hot jungle fi lls the entire chamber. An old man sits at a worktable and is easily spotted when the PCs enter the chamber. Other features of the enclosed greenhouse are described below.

## Setup

**Light**: The glass ceiling allows the light of day to stream into the chamber (bright light).

**Sound**: PCs can automatically hear insects chirping and the patter of rain on the glass ceiling. A DC 14 Listen check reveals rustling deep within the indoor jungle (this is a dire ape, see below).

**Reaction**: If the PCs attack the old man, six Citadel guards appear in 1d4+1 rounds to protect him. Citadel guards are 3rd-level fighters

## Challenge

The old man is Viorr Maelak, the one who summoned the adventurers. He is a captain in the King’s Dark Lanterns, the covert intelligence arm of the King’s Citadel of Breland. He has heard of the PCs’ exploits and hopes they can help him resolve the Lucan situation. First, however, he wants to test their skills to make sure that there is at least some truth to the tales he has heard regarding them.

When the PCs enter the greenhouse, read:

An elderly human sits at a worktable at the edge of the indoor jungle. Pale and gaunt, he arranges orchids in a vase. Gardening implements cover the worktable, and a silver cane and a satchel hangs from the back of the man’s chair. He says in a whispery voice, “I am Viorr Maelak. Welcome to my little piece of the wild.”

After the PCs have introduced themselves and perhaps exchanged some pleasantries, read:

“I do have a job for you, a job that will make you rich,” Viorr says as he reaches into a pocket. He pulls out potion vials and starts placing them in a neat row at the edge of the table. “But if you’ll indulge me, there’s a bit of an audition first. There’s a wild ape in my greenhouse. I’d like you to defeat it without killing it. Unconscious is fine, bleeding is fine, magically subdued is fine. Just don’t kill it. These are healing potions. Use them however you like. Oh, and do be careful. The ape is carnivorous and quite hungry.”

If the dire ape misses the same opponent twice in a row, it grows frustrated. On its next turn, it attempts to grapple and pin the foe, then rend it to death.

## Obstacles

There are six potions of healing on the table. Viorr follows the PCs as they explore the trails through the indoor jungle, limping along behind them with his cane. He won’t intervene in a fight. Viorr deflects any questions the PCs have, saying, “Ape first; questions later. I want to see what you’re capable of.”

## Additional Details

The PCs have to contend with forest terrain during this encounter. The trees provide a measure of cover (+2 bonus to AC) and a high vantage point (with a DC 15 Climb check). The light undergrowth provides concealment and increases the DC of Tumble and Move Silently checks by 2. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square with light undergrowth (any squares on the map that contain jungle are considered to have light undergrowth). If the PCs accidentally kill the dire ape, Viorr still decides to work with them if he believes they were trying to subdue it. In such a case, reduce his initial offer of payment in the next encounter by 20% to refl ect his lessened confi dence in their abilities. When this encounter ends, Viorr leads the PCs back to his worktable. The encounter “A Mandate and a Mission” begins.
