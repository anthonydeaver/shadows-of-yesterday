# <center>4 - The Mournland</center>

## Overview

Cyre, once the jewel of the Galifar crown, was destroyed four years ago in a terrible and mysterious release of arcane energy. In the afterglow of the devastating effect, the Mournland was born. See pages 188â€“191 of the Eberron Campaign Setting for complete details on the Mournland. 

A number of encounters are presented for use during this portion of the adventure. Only two of these actually need to occur: the Dead-Gray Mist and the Mouth of the Mine. Use the others as you see fi t as the PCs make their way into the desolate region. The encounters are not keyed to a map; they are sequential events presented in the order that they should occur.
