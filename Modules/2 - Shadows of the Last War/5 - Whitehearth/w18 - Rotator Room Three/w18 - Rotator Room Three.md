# <center>w18 - Rotator Room Three</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

This chamber is similar to area W2, except the control panel has a different confi guration of colored slots. See the diagram above for details.

## Obstacles

If a character uses an orange keycharm before using a red keycharm, the chamber slowly rotates. The everbright lantern goes out and the room is plunged into darkness. When the chamber finally comes to a stop, the entrance is pointed straight down into a well. Anyone in the chamber must make a DC 5 Dexterity check to keep from sliding through the hole and falling into the water below.

Anyone who falls into the water takes falling damage as usual (itâ€™s a drop of 30 feet to the surface of the water), and then needs to make Swim checks to avoid drowning in the 20-foot-deep well.

Until the red keycharm is used to turn off the trap, only the green keycharm slot and the opening to the well can be accessed.
