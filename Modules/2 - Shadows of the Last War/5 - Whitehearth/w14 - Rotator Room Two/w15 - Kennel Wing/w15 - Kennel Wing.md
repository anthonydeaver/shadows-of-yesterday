# <center>w15 - Kennel Wing</center>

## Overview

**Type**: Complex

This corridor, accessed by a green keycharm, leads to the kennel. Normal wolves and a strange stone wolf occupy this wing of the facility.

## Description

If the party tries to enter area W17 before area W16, each character needs to make a Move Silently check opposed by the stone wolfâ€™s Listen check. If anyone fails this check, the stone wolf emerges from area W16 to investigate. However, it cannot open doors, so the PCs can quickly duck into W17 and close the door.

**Light**: Dim everbright lanterns provide shadowy illumination.

**Sound**: Any PC who makes a successful DC 13 Listen check can hear the growls and snarls of wolves coming from area W16.

**Reaction**: If the PCs make their presence know, the stone wolf comes to investigate.
