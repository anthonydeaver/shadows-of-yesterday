# <center>5.1.7 - Chamber of Circles</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Indoors

**Encounter Type**: Exploration

The stairs ascend to the Chamber of Circles. In this room, the PCs must deal with a swarm of insects (Centipedes) before they can reachLucan’s hiding place.

**Light**: None

**Sound**: The PCs can head faint scurrying from the centipedes on the wall with a DC 10 Perception check

**Reaction**: None

## Setup

When the PCs reach the doorway, read:

This long chamber has three silver circles embossed in the floor, and a doorway in the far wall. The wall to the left has many cracks in it, and the air smells a little fresher here. All four walls feature frescoes depicting a starry night over forbiddingly mountainous terrain—nothing like this flooded plain.

## Participants

When the PCs start moving across the room, centipedes pour through the cracks in the wall. One round later, they form into a swarm and attack.

## Challenge

Centipede Tactics: The centipedes scurry across the fl oor, trying to engulf as many PCs as possible. The summoning circles no longer function, but the centipedes still won’t cross the line and enter the middle circle.
