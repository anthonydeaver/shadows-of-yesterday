# <center>2.2 - The Sea Dart</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Other

**Setting**: Nautical

**Encounter Type**: Roleplaying

The waterfront area of the Grayflood district bustles with laborers and sailors. Arcane and mundane cranes abound to help with the lifting of crates and boxes, so magical auras abound.

**Light**: Daylight

**Sound**: Ship horns, laborers’ calls, mundane dockyard noises (automatic).

## Setup
![Map!](otxvg4rw.fd3.png)

The Sea Dart has a narrow bridge at the ship’s front, an observation blister (which serves as the all-hands area and cafeteria), a galley for food preparation and storage, the captain’s quarters, crew quarters, two small berths (each able to hold up to four passengers), a cargo hold (a thin horizontal space beneath the cargo hold contains a minor elemental binding ring of air that keeps the atmosphere in the undersea ship breathable, as well as the magic equipment that supports the main elemental binding ring), and a small armory and airlock containing eight water crossbows (special projectile weapons that can be used underwater) and twelve potions of water breathing. 

 

The window in the observation blister can be magically commanded to view any exterior quadrant of the undersea ship, including to the rear.

Assuming the characters accept Elaydren’s commission, they eventually find themselves at the docks of Grayflood. Questions about Byam quickly provide directions to a gnome engaged in a game of dice with other sailors. He asks the adventurers to wait while he finishes the game and collects his winnings. If the adventurers show Byam the letter of passage from Elaydren, he nods and leads them to a warehouse set back from the docks. 

The gnome with the short, dark hair and colorful speech leads you into the warehouse. Inside, hidden from view, a sunken pool contains a strange-looking vessel. It looks superficially like an airship that has fallen into the water, complete with an elemental binding ring. However, the binding ring contains violently spinning water instead of the airy or fiery torus normally seen on airships. The craft’s shape seems strangely thin and elongated. Moreover, every compartment is sealed inside the hull. Several gnome crew members are in the process of transferring cargo crates into an open hatchway on top of the craft. “This is the Sea Dart, my friends, and I am its captain, Byam of the ocean depths!”

Byam knows that the characters need to reach Stormreach as quickly as possible, though he doesn’t know why—nor does he want to know. As a loyal retainer of House Cannith, he has agreed to work for Lady Elaydren without asking questions. 

 

Elaydren told Byam that the characters are experienced hands and capable warriors. Byam plans to take a route through Shargon’s Teeth that will allow him to cut more than a day off the trip. He hopes it won’t come to it, but Byam has decided to gamble on the PCs being able to help put down any attempted sahuagin piracy. 

 

Byam shows the characters to their berths. Because of space constraints, four characters are packed into a room that has two narrow sets of double bunk beds.

## Development

​The top maintainable speed of the [[Sea Dart]] is approximately 15 miles per hour. The bound [[Water Elemental]] that powers the vehicle never tires, so assuming there is no trouble, and accounting for terrain, the Sea Dart can make the trip around Shargon’s Teeth and on to [[Stormreach]] in about five days. However, Byam’s desire to follow Elaydren’s orders and get the adventurers to the trade settlement as quickly as possible puts the undersea ship on a course through Shargon’s Teeth. Provided all goes well, this cuts the length of the trip to approximately three and a half days.​
