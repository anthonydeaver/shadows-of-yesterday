## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

## Setup

This corridor, accessed by a blue keycharm, leads to the area where the House Cannith researchers went to rest and relax after each day’s work.

**Light**: The weakened everbright lanterns provide shadowy illumination.

**Sound**: A DC 12 Perception check alerts a PC to the sound of crackling fl ames from area W5.

**Reaction**: The living flaming sphere attacks any intruders it notices.

## Challenge

The rotator room opens on a corridor that smells of burnt wood and charred fl esh. Soot and ash coat the corridor and stick to the walls and ceiling. A metal door at the end of the hall appears to have melted into slag.

 

When the disaster reached Whitehearth, a spell that one of the researchers was casting got out of control and turned into a living spell. The living fl aming sphere burned everything it could, and happily moves to destroy the PCs once it realizes they have intruded upon its private domain.

Everyone notices a glow such as that cast by a bonfire coming from the room at the end of the hall (area W5). Anyone who makes a DC 12 Perception check also notices a number of human bones mixed in with the soot and ash that covers the fl oor.

If the PCs move quietly, they can reach the rooms at the end of the hall without incident. If they don’t take care to be quiet, the living fl aming sphere from area W5 makes a Perception check to notice the sound of the approaching PCs. If the living fl aming sphere succeeds on the check, it engages the party in the narrow corridor.
