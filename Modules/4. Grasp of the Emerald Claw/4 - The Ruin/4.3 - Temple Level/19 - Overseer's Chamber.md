# <center>19 - Overseer's Chamber</center>

## Overview

**Type**: Room

## Description

This was the chamber of the slavesâ€™ overseer. Once, it was a place of pain and misery. Now only a handful of memories remain from those ancient days. Read:

Brownish red stains smear the south wall of this chamber, where a few chains remain in perfect condition, trailing from hooks set high on the wall. Manacles small enough for a human wrist dangle from each end. 

## DM info

Of all the disciplinary equipment that once existed in this chamber (which the giants applied to their slaves), only three sets of chains and manacles remain, each containing a minor enchantment to ward off the ravages of time.
