# <center>4 - Travel by Lightening Rail</center>

## Overview

This part of the adventure features a three-way battle aboard a lightning rail coach bound for Flamekeep, the capital city of Thrane. The coach follows the path of conductor stones from Sterngate to Starilaskur, onto Vathirond, and then north through Thrane toward Flamekeep. Lucan plans to be aboard the morning coach. To stay on his trail, the PCs must also make it aboard before the coach departs. 

 

Among the various things the PCs do upon reaching Sterngate, including getting healed, resting, resupplying, and recovering spells, they see that a lightning rail coach is parked in the fortress-town’s station. A few inquiries allow them to learn that the coach departs in the morning (some ten hours after they arrive in Sterngate) for Flamekeep and other locations to the north. In lieu of an airship, this is the fastest mode of travel for continuing on to Karrnath. 

 

The lightning rail coach consists of a train of special- purpose carts. Two crew carts, one at the front and one at the rear, house the primary elemental bindings. Four passenger carts, two lounge carts, and two cargo carts make up the rest of the train.

Catching the Coach: After getting through the night in Sterngate, the PCs must be aboard the lightning rail coach before it departs in the morning. Lucan reached the station ahead of the PCs and was able to secure a private cabin on the coach. 

 

The PCs must get on the lightning rail before it departs after the sun rises. To do that, they have to get past the surprises Lucan left for them on the station.
