# <center>5.1 - The Ziggurat</center>

## Overview

The PCs reach a ziggurat that rises above a still lake. To start this part of the adventure, read:

Across the still water, an ancient temple rises into the night sky. The water surrounds it even as the night enfolds it. A stairway on the outside of the temple leads to a broad doorway that opens into darkness. Lucan appears in the doorway, staring across the lake in your direction. Then he steps into the shadows and disappears inside.

A structure remaining from the height of the Dhakaani Empire, the ziggurat stands in a shallow depression on an otherwise featureless plain. Due to the rainy season, a lake has sprung up around the ziggurat and moisture has seeped into its lower levels.

 

Inside the ziggurat, walls are made of superior masonry (Climb DC 20) and the fl oors are fl agstone. Ceilings in the rooms are 15 feet high unless otherwise specifi ed. The few doors that exist are stone; they aren’t locked, but they are stuck (Strength DC 28 to open, or hardness 8 and 60 hp if attacked directly). There’s no natural light anywhere in the ziggurat, so the PCs have to provide illumination unless they all have darkvision. 

 

Hallways and staircases between the chambers are 10 feet high and 10 feet wide. They have iron sconces every 40 feet for torches or lanterns, but the light sources themselves disappeared long ago. 

 

This ziggurat was dedicated to an ancient fi end that was worshiped for a time in this part of the empire. Few goblinoids today remember, let alone venerate, this once-powerful entity. The place has a reputation for being haunted, and few brave this location. 

 

Reaching the central stairs that lead to the ziggurat entrance requires crossing a quarter-mile-wide lake, which has an average depth of 10 feet. If the PCs are unwilling to swim the distance, they can use wood from a thin copse of trees nearby to make a 10-foot-by- 10-foot raft. One character can do this work in twelve hours; if more than one PC participates, the time is reduced proportionately (so four PCs could build a raft in three hours).
