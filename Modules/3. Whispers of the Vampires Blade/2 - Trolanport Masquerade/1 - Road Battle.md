## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

## Setup

Lucan and Grilsha had some trouble replacing their fatigued horses at a small gnome hamlet about 160 miles or so from [[Trolanport]]. This delay gives the PCs the opportunity to catch up with them and have their fi rst encounter with the rogue Dark Lantern agent. This encounter takes place at dusk, just before full [[3. - Darkness|darkness]] overtakes the land.

**Light**: Dusk at start (shadowy illumination); night falls 3 [[1. - Rounds|rounds]] into the encounter.

**Sound**: None.

**Reaction**: When Grilsha spots the PCs, she tries to outrun them.

## Participants

This is the first face-to-face meeting between the PCs and Grilsha. It begins when they spot Lucan’s coach ahead of them on the road. Read:

As you crest a low rise in the road, you see ahead of you the black coach you’ve long been looking for. A shadowy figure controls the reins, but you notice long flowing red hair trailing from the figure as the black coach speeds along the road.

## Challenge

Have the PCs roll [[3. - Initiative|initiative]] to keep track of everyone’s actions. The coach is 1,200 feet ahead of them when the encounter begins.

 

Unless the PCs do something unusual, Grilsha spots them—if she looks behind her. Every round there’s a 25% chance she’ll do this (roll at the start of the round). The coach moves at 50 feet per round before Grilsha notices the PCs, and 150 feet per round once she notices them and directs the horses to run. If the PCs direct their magebred horses to run, they can [[e. - Cover|cover]] 180 feet per round.

 

Because this encounter starts with a linear chase on a straight section of road, you might try relative mapping rather than standard mapping. Put the coach near one edge of the map, and move the PCs toward it each round based on how much ground they make up. Switch to standard mapping when the coach stops.

## Background

Lucan appealed to his sister for help, and she agreed. She doesn’t care that he has become a [[Vampire|vampire]]. She has promised to help him elude pursuit and reach[[Karrnath]] with the soul blade. Lucan is asleep in his coffi n inside the coach when the encounter starts.

Grilsha’s Tactics: Grilsha casts [[Mage Armor|mage armor]] and [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/items/shield|shield]] in the first two [[1. - Rounds|rounds]] after she notices the PCs, hunkering forward on the coach to get [[e. - Cover|cover]] against foes behind her. In the likely event that the PCs gain on her, she starts attacking their horses. She uses her [[Lightning Bolt|lightning bolt]] and fireball scrolls to damage as many pursuers as possible, and then aims at the horses with [[Magic Missile|magic missile]] spells or her [[Hand crossbow|hand crossbow]]. She also kicks the coach wall as hard as she can until Lucan wakes up. If things turn sour, she uses [[invisibility|Invisibility]] and [[fly|Fly]] to get out of the immediate area, followed by her [[Phantom Steed|phantom steed]] scrolls to finish the trip to [[Trolanport]].

Lucan’s Tactics: There’s a 50% chance each round that Lucan wakes up, and he automatically wakes up if the coach stops. During his first round awake, he gets out of his coffin. Next, he opens the shutter on the back of the coach (treat as an arrow slit) and uses his children of the night ability to call wolves from the forest off the side of the road. He watches the fight from within the coach, only emerging if Grilsha goes down or the coach stops. Lucan uses his alternate form or [[Gaseous Form|gaseous form]] ability to escape into the forest; he has no interest in fighting at this point in the adventure.

## Additional Details

In the likely event that Lucan and Grilsha escape, they continue their journey to [[Trolanport]], laying low and buying another coffin if necessary. When the PCs reach[[Trolanport]] and try to find Lucan or the meaning of the word “krell,” go to the [[2 - Trolanport Inquisitive Work|Trolanport Inquisitive Work]] encounter. The PCs have more journeying—and thus more chances for random encounters—to accomplish before they reach the capital of [[Zilargo]], however.
