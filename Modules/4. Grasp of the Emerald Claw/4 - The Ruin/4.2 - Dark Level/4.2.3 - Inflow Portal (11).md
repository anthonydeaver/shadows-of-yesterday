# <center>4.2.3 - Inflow Portal (11)</center>

## Overview

**Type**: Waypoint
*annotation:* Aura: Strong conjuration (teleportation) from the portal.

This one-way portal open to the elemental waters of Lamannia was once used for arcane experiments but now allows water to fl ow freely into the chamber.

## Description

When the adventurers approach this area, read:

This massive stone support contains a 5-foot-diameter opening in its face, from which spurts a steady stream of water. The water is clear, pure, and cold. The lowest portion of the opening is seven feet above the floor.

## DM info

This is the source of the water that fills this level. It is a one-way portal from the elemental pools of water that cover Lamannia; you canâ€™t enter the plane through this portal. You can, however, enter through the [[4.2.4 - Outflow Portal (12)|outflow portal]].
