# <center>1 - The Bloody Bridge</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Outdoors

**Encounter Type**: Combat

A stroll across the platforms, balconies, and sky bridges of [[Sharn]] on a stormy evening leads to a disturbing discovery.

## Setup
![Map!](bloody-bridge.png)

Curtains of water fall from the sky as you traverse the labyrinthine walkways of [[Sharn]]. The stone and wooden paths wind around and between the towers and spires high above the ground, forming a complex latticework that can be very confusing on evenings such as this. The rain falls hard, running off higher walkways and balconies in drenching waves, making it difficult to see much more than a few feet ahead of you. The distant glow of everbright lanterns, barely visible in the soaking gloom, does little to light the paths on this warm, wet evening.

When the adventurers reach the spot marked “A” on the map, have them make DC 18 Perceptionchecks. Characters who fail the check don’t immediately notice the body lying on the skybridge ahead or the cloaked fi gure slipping into the nearby shadows. They don’t notice the body until they get closer, within 60 feet of the [[Prone|prone]] form. 

Any characters that succeed on the check notice the clocked figure. Read aloud:

You spot a figure in a dark cloak moving quietly through the rain on the skybridge ahead. It seems to be avoiding the dim pools of light cast by the everbright lanterns, preferring to stay to the shadows. Lightning flashes, and you see a shape on the stone floor of the bridge in the brief illumination. The figure quickly reaches the railing of the skybridge, then slips over the barrier and disappears into the darkness and the rain.

When the adventurers get within 60 feet of the body, or if those who spotted the cloaked fi gure move toward the bridge to investigate, read:

The skybridge ahead spans the distance between platforms attached to the sides of two different towers—Dalannan Tower and the Kelsa Spire. A body lies on the floor of the bridge, and you can see a mixture of rain and blood pooling around it. A leather satchel, still clutched tightly in the body’s hand, lies in the expanding puddle of water and gore.

## Challenge

As the adventurers approach the scene of the crime, [[The Cloaked Figure (CR 1)|the cloaked figure]] who disappeared over the side of the skybridge works its way across the underside to [[2. - Surprise|surprise]] them. The fi gure beneath the cloak is a warforged named Cutter, a follower of the Lord of Blades. Like her leader, Cutter believes that the warforged shall rise up and overthrow the “weak-fl eshed” races. She bears the mark of [[Karrnath]] on her brow, though she abandoned that nation to join the Lord of Blades in [[The Mournland|the Mournland]]. Now, she has come to [[Sharn]] for a purpose.

## Rewards

The PCs can’t make a thorough examination of the body or the satchel until after they deal with the cloaked fi gure.

The PCs either discover the journal if they [[Search|search]] the leather satchel, or they receive it later from [[2 - The City Watch (CR 5)|the City Watch]] (see below). When the PCs examine the journal, read:

This small journal, measuring about 3 inches by 6 inches and 1 inch thick, has a cover of dark brown leather with strands of mithral thread woven in a strange pattern. It bears no title, just the mithral-thread icon on the front cover. Inside, every page is blank, but the sheets have a strange feel; they don’t seem to be paper or leather, but something not readily identifiable.

A small pouch hanging on the body’s belt contains 10 silver pieces and 2 gold pieces. The satchel, obviously well made and stylish, contains quills and inks, six blank sheets of fi ne Karrnathi paper, a wrapped apple, and Bonal’s journal.

The journal is extremely resistant to damage, including fi re, and any attempts to write in the journal using ordinary means fail. Ink, charcoal, chalk, and other normal writing mediums simply slide off the blank sheets. The journal radiates a strong aura of universal magic. A DC 15 Knowledge (nobility and royalty) check allows a PC to recognize the icon on the cover as a primitive version of the [[House Cannith]] seal, showing a stylized anvil and hammer inside a circle.
