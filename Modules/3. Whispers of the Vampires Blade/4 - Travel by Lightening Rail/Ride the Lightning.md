## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Indoors

**Encounter Type**: Combat

It takes thirteen hours for the lightning rail coach to reach its fi rst stop in the city of Starilaskur. The layover is brief—three hours to allow passengers to leave and board the coach, and to take on supplies and drop off cargo. The next leg of the trip also takes thirteen hours; then the coach spends another three hours in Vathirond before leaving Breland and entering the nation of Thrane. The attack at the heart of this encounter occurs three hours after the coach departs Vathirond, about two hours after dark on the second day of travel. 

 

Along the way, Lucan remains in hiding. The walls of all the private cabins within the passenger carts are lined with a thin sheet of lead to protect passengers from spells such as locate object (and, in Lucan’s case, detect undead). The walls of the cargo carts and many of the cargo containers have the same protection. House Orien believes that privacy must be protected at all costs. The dominated cargo driver visits Lucan’s cabin once during each leg of the trip; Lucan feeds on a small amount of the driver’s blood during each of these visits. 

 

The coach’s crew won’t allow the PCs to barge into private cabins, and House Orien doesn’t answer to Breland’s king, so the traveling papers the PCs carry have little weight in this area. The best they can do is interact with the passengers and crew and bide their time, waiting for Lucan to show himself or make some kind of mistake.

 

Shortly after the coach departs the Vathirond station, early in the evening of the second day of travel, the PCs’ past actions catch up with them. An agent of the Lord of Blades, still tracking the PCs in hopes of recovering the schemas used in the Xen’drik creation pattern, attacks the lightning rail. That’s when things get interesting. If the PCs didn’t participate in either of the previous adventures (The Forgotten Forge or Shadows of the Last War), then this is merely a case of mistaken identity. Of course, convincing the warforged of that is nearly impossible.

## Setup

You can play out some of the investigation and interaction with passengers and crew. You can even allow the PCs to take care of business in either Starilaskur or Vathirond during the brief stops in those cities. The heart of this encounter, however, is the attack by the warforged. Fast-forward through the travel to this point as slowly or as quickly as you and your players are comfortable with. Cut to the highlights and play out a few representative scenes along the way.

 

​This encounter can begin in two ways. If a PC is keeping watch somehow—probably from the back of the last cart, engageftpuserhe or she sees warforged board the coach. But if all the PCs are resting or relaxing, the attack comes as a surprise. Determine where each of the PCs are aboard the coach after night falls during the trip from Vathirond to Aruldusk. If the PCs have someone watching outside, read:



If the PC's are watching: As the elemental-powered coach labors a bit to climb a low rise, you see figures in bulky cloaks on horses galloping alongside. Then the cloaked figures leap from their horses to the sideboards on the carts. Some board the forward crew cart, while others board at the rear crew cart. Then, a half-dozen creatures swoop out of the sky, each bearing a small rider.

If the PC's are not watching: A commotion in the cart toward the rear of the coach interrupts the relaxing sway of the speeding lightning rail. Through the passageway, you see a cloaked figure with a longsword at the throat of a passenger—an elderly human woman who appears frightened almost to the point of panic. Before you can react, a fierce-looking halfling on a winged creature soars past the window of the cart you’re in.

The cloaked fi gures are warforged agents of the Lord of Blades. The warforged have descriptions of the PCs and are systematically searching the coach for them. They don’t know or care about Lucan, though they’d be happy to secure the soul blade for their master should the opportunity arise.

## Participants

​Two groups of warforged, four in the forward crew cart and five searching the other carts from rear to front. Their leader, Scimitar, commands the latter group. Six halfling mercenaries on glidewings patrol outside the coach. Lucan (and Grilsha, if she is still with him) remains in hiding until the opportunity to escape presents itself (see Ending the Encounter).​

​Warforged tactics: The two groups of warforged are unsubtle opponents, although they’re smart enough to try to push foes off the lightning rail with a bull rush attempt if the opportunity arises. The Lord of Blades has filled their minds with propaganda, so they fight to the death to promote his cause. 

 

The warforged who boarded the forward crew cart subdue the crew there and order the coach driver to stop the lightning rail. He refuses. Refer to Ending the Encounter for the results of this interaction. 

 

Scimitar is a trusted agent of the Lord of Blades. She demands that the PCs surrender and provide her with either the schemas or information on where she can find them. If the PCs don’t cooperate, she has orders to kill all but one of them. The survivor will be taken for further questioning by the Lord of Blades himself. 

 

Unlike the other warforged, Scimitar has a strong sense of self-preservation. She retreats if her life is at risk or if the mission looks doomed to failure.​

Halfling Tactics: The halflings and glidewings are content to circle the lightning rail coach, but they fl ing javelins at any creature on the roof or side running boards of the carts, circling so they remain about 30 feet away from their targets. If a few rounds of javelin barrages aren’t effective, the halfings swoop close to the coach and charge with their lances. If a halfling falls in battle, the remaining halflings concentrate on the PC who dealt the killing blow. They rage at this point, jumping onto the coach to attack the PCs directly. The halflings, being hired help, fl ee if the battle doesn’t go easily. A raging halfling won’t retreat before his or her rage ends, however.

## Challenge

Nine warforged have boarded the coach. Four of them work to secure the forward crew cart and stop the coach. Five, including the lead agent known as Scimitar, have dealt with anyone in the rear crew cart and have begun working their way forward, searching for the PCs and dealing with potential threats along the way. They plan to halt the coach and make a thorough search of every cart until they have captured the PCs. 

 

Outside, six halfling mercenaries ride glidewings and watch for anyone other than the warforged attempting to leave the coach. They have orders to attack anyone outside the coach who isn’t a warforged.

## Rewards

Award the PCs full experience for each foe they defeat in combat, but don’t award experience for Lucan’s retreat or any halflings who simply fl y away.

## Development

This is a set-piece battle, so there’s a lot going on. You have four groups of NPCs to keep track of, plus the “actions” of the moving coach. But not every group confronts the PCs at the same time, so don’t worry about the actions of NPCs who are “offstage.” Pace yourself as you provide threats one or two at a time. For example, perhaps the PCs fight Scimitar and her warforged party for a few rounds before Lucan appears. Then the PCs chase Lucan forward from cart to cart for a few rounds as the coach speeds up. Then Lucan takes to the roof and at least some PCs follow, bringing the halflings into the fray. The rest of the PCs encounter the other team of warforged just as the coach grinds to a halt. After the coach stops, the PCs finish off any surviving warforged and wonder where Lucan fl ed to. 

 

At your gaming table, the easiest way to handle this combat is to treat the coach carts as stationary and move the terrain around it. With a fl y speed of 80 feet, the halflings’ glidewings are easily fast enough to keep up. 

 

It’s often difficult to keep track of events when a party splits up, but in this battle you can switch back and forth between PCs in different coach carts by simply cycling through the initiative order; imagine a movie that cuts between two tense situations. 

PCs are generally adept at using their surroundings to advantage. Here are some clever tricks they might employ.

 

Climb onto the Roof: Hatches and ladders are located at the rear of each cart. It takes a move action to open the hatch. It’s a DC 0 Strength check to get up the ladder, but it takes 40 feet of movement to do so. A DC 5 Strength Climb check gets a character up the ladder with only 20 feet of movement. Unless PCs are unusually burdened, failure simply means no progress on the climb, not an actual fall.

 

Fall or Jump off the Coach: Treat this as a normal fall, except that it deals 2d6 points of damage due to the coach’s forward speed. A character can reduce the damage to 1d6 points if he or she jumps down intentionally and succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check or if he or she succeeds on a DC 15 Acrobatics check..

 

Push Someone Off: A bull rush attack suffices to push someone off the roof of the coach. Attempting to do so from the outer balconies is harder; the presence of the rail gives the defender a +2 bonus on the opposed check to avoid being bull rushed.

 

Grab at a Railing: If a character is falling off the coach for whatever reason, a DC 20 Strength check lets him grab onto a guardrail or similar protuberance. A character can pull himself back up to safety by taking a move action and making a DC 10 Strength check, but he’s hanging by his fingertips until he does so.

## Ending the Encounter

Four rounds into the battle, the driver increases the speed of the coach. In the fifth round, the warforged in the crew cart kill him, causing the coach to slide to a stop. (The coach won’t run without the driver.) When the coach suddenly stops, each individual on board needs to make a DC 15 Balance check to remain standing. Failure indicates that the sudden stop sends the character crashing into a wall or the floor. Those inside a cart who fail take 1d6 points of damage. Those on the roof of a cart can make a second check to avoid falling off (see above). 

 

Lucan emerges from hiding at this point. He jumps from the coach, takes the form of a dire wolf, and disappears into the night. Where is Lucan going? Toward the ruined ziggurat he sees in the distance.
