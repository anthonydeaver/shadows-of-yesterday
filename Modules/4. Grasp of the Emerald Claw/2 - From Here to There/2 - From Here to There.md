## Overview

This part of the adventure deals with the trip from Sharn to Stormreach, on the northern coast of Xen’drik. The adventurers must brave the Straits of Shargon and safely pass through Shargon’s Teeth, the realm of the sahuagin, to reach the mysterious continent. The PCs have two hours to purchase supplies and make any other arrangements they like. Then, back at Elaydren’s town house, they receive the advance on their payment, last-minute instructions, and passage on a strange new vehicle—an undersea ship.
