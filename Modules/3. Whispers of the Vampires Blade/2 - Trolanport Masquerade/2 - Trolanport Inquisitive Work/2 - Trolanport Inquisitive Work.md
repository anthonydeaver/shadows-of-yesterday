## Overview

**Scene Type**: Transition

**Encounter Type**: Social

**Light**: Overcast daylight (bright illumination).

**Sound**: Talking, clattering hooves, haggling, water splashing in the canals, and other typical city sounds (automatic), sneaking sahuagin (Stealth +1).

**Reaction**: To combat on city streets—1d4+4 gnome guards arrive in 1d4+4 rounds. Gnome guards are 1st level warriors (Monster Manual, page 134).

## Setup

Trolanport is the capital of the gnome nation of Zilargo. Unlike other cities, the coastal metropolis features a crisscrossing network of canals and fl ooded thoroughfares instead of solid streets. The city also has streets made of stone and a variety of bridges connecting them, but the easiest way to get around is by using the small boats that travel up and down the canals.

 

​In Trolanport, the PCs can attempt to locate Lucan and Grilsha, or they can try to fi nd out what “krell” is. Refer to “Background,” below, for more details.



## Background

The PCs need to dig up some leads as to where Lucan has gone, or to the meaning of the word “krell” that Viorr told them he found among Lucan’s notes. While the PCs move around the city tracking down leads, sahuagin muggers silently track them through the waterways and eventually confront them.
