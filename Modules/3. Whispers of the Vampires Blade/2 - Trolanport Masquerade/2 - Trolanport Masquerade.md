# <center>2 - Trolanport Masquerade</center>

## Overview

Let the PCs make whatever preparations they want, just so long as they’re on their way within the hour. On the magebred horses, the PCs can cover 50 miles per day of travel. Lucan has about an eight-hour lead on the PCs (one day of normal travel), and he pushes so that his coach covers about 80 miles per day. It’s about 800 miles along an Orien trade road from [[Sharn]] to [[Trolanport]], traveling along the southern edge of the King’s Forest before crossing the Trolan River and reaching the gnome city. That means, if all goes well, it takes Lucan ten days to reach[[Trolanport]]. But it doesn’t go well. Lucan has trouble getting a new team of horses while he’s still two days out from [[Trolanport]]. He’s just getting back on the road on the twelfth day as the PCs catch up with him. (It takes the PCs sixteen days to make the trip if they travel at a normal pace of eight hours per day. If they decide to push their mounts, they will have to replace them after four consecutive days of accelerated travel.)

Along the way, there is a 10% chance per hour of travel that the PCs encounter someone else on the road. While camped, if the PCs aren’t resting at an inn, the encounter chance increases to 20% per eight hours (make the check twice per resting period). If an encounter is indicated, refer to the table below.

## The Situation

Four heavy horses pull Lucan’s coach. His sister, Grilsha, travels with him. She has agreed to help him out of family loyalty and because she loves her brother, despite the affl iction that has turned him into a vampire. Lucan pushes his team of horses, making them travel sixteen hours per day. Every four days, he purchases replacement mounts and sells his fatigued horses. The PCs can discover this by making DC 10 Investigation checks when they pull into towns along the way and take the time to ask around. 

 

On the PCs’ twelfth day of travel (sixth day, if they pushed their mounts as Lucan did), the adventurers catch up to Lucan’s coach. Go on to the “[[1 - Road Battle|Road Battle]]” encounter.
