## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Indoors
*annotation:* Ballroom

**Encounter Type**: Social

This set-piece encounter provides opportunities for the adventurers to interact and verbally spar with NPCs. The sparring gets signifi cantly more physical at the encounter’s end, transforming the party into a confusing fi ght when Aundairian agents make their move on Lucan.

**Light**: Dancing light spells drift across the room, providing an equal chance each round for bright or shadowy illumination.

**Sound**: Murmuring of the crowd and music from an elf quartet on the stage (automatic; imposes –5 penalty on Perception checks to hear other sounds because of the volume).

**Reaction**: To drawn weapons or actual combat—1d4 embassy guards arrive in 3 rounds (automatic).

## Setup
![Picture (Simple)!](embassy.png)
*annotation:* Ballroom


Neya ir’Krell, the ranking Aundairian diplomat in Trolanport, leads a double life. In addition to being a diplomat for her nation, she also serves as an agent for the Royal Eyes of Aundair, the intelligence-gathering arm of the crown of Aundair. This high society masquerade ball provides cover for a number of Neya’s various covert activities, as well as being an evening’s entertainment for some of the most powerful and influential people in Trolanport. Anyone who’s anyone in Trolanport’s diplomatic community attends the annual Aundairian masquerade ball.

 

Neya serves two masters tonight. Her loyalty to and friendship with Lucan (she doesn’t know he’s a vampire now) compel her to provide the aid he requested—traveling papers and passage to Karrnath. Her loyalty to Aundair, however, demands that she capture Lucan and turn him over to her superiors in the Royal Eyes. Neya doesn’t see a confl ict between these divided loyalties. She puts a trap in place for Lucan, working with the agent Meena ir’Erdalis, while also agreeing to provide Lucan with the aid he needs. If Lucan escapes the trap, he is free to leave Zilargo and continue his journey. If he can’t, Neya reasons, that’s not her problem.

 

The guests include gnome government offi cials and diplomats, diplomats from the Five Nations working in Trolanport, and select representatives from a few of the dragonmarked houses. A quartet of elf musicians plays in the far corner of the ballroom. The quartet uses a guitar, fl ute, harpsichord, and drum. These elves are excellent entertainers who also happen to work for the House Thuranni Shadow Network of spies and information brokers. 

 

Unless the PCs purchased costumes, they take a –2 penalty on Charisma-based checks because the guests and servants regard them with suspicion for being improperly dressed for the occasion. 

 

The masks and costumes mean that just as it’s hard for the PCs to fi nd Lucan or Neya, so too is it diffi cult for Lucan to fi nd Neya or Meena to fi nd Lucan. Thus, the PCs have some time to mill around and get a sense of the room before anything else happens. They can dance, chat with some of Trolanport’s more important diplomats and citizens, or simply eat and drink like nobles for an evening. 

 

Use the Aundairian Ballroom map, printed on the inside of the cover, when running this encounter. 

 

When the PCs get past the guards at the doors and you’re ready to start the encounter, read:

Every wall of the ballroom has been festooned with black and white crepe, and drifting, darting magical lights provide the room’s illumination. A quartet of elf musicians plays in a far corner of the ballroom, providing music for approximately a dozen dancers. About forty other people sit at round tables or stand around the edge of the dance floor, conversing in quiet tones while servants bring them drinks and small tidbits of food. The ballroom’s most striking feature is the costumes that everyone— host, guest, and servant alike—wears. Everyone also wears a mask, many decorated with feathers, fur, sequins, or costume jewelry. Many of the women have on long, diaphanous gowns, while the men wear form-fitting breeches and vests that glitter with golden thread and the sparkle of tiny gems. It appears that about a third of the guests are gnomes.

## Participants

By the time the PCs make their way into the ballroom, a number of important NPCs are already present. These include Lucan (wearing an eagle mask), Grilsha (wearing an owl mask), Neya ir’Krell (wearing a gold dragon mask), and Meena ir’Erdalis (wearing a blue dragon mask), an agent of the Royal Eyes of Aundair determined to capture and interrogate Lucan. Statistics for Neya and Meena, as well as Meena’s agents (who wear simple domino masks), follow.

## Challenge

Unless the PCs do something to intervene, the events in this encounter occur in a certain order, each one happening a number of minutes after the PCs enter the ballroom. 

 

15 Minutes: Lucan locates Neya. He greets her and leads her to the dance fl oor. Neya gives Lucan the password he needs to board the airship, as well as a small pouch containing traveling papers and a letter of credit. Meena arrives at the affair with her agents. Meena is a legitimate guest; her agents are disguised as servants. 

 

20 Minutes: During their dance, Neya noticed that Lucan’s hands were cold, and they didn’t warm to her touch. After the dance, she discreetly sends for a spellcaster to cast a divination and fi nd out what has happened to her longtime contact. Neya also encourages Lucan to engage other guests in conversation (so he doesn’t leave before she determines what’s going on). 

 

25 Minutes: Meena fi nds Lucan and asks him to dance. He accepts. 

 

30 Minutes: Meena tries to use a charm person spell on Lucan in the middle of the dance fl oor. It fails automatically, because undead are immune to mindaffecting spells. Meena recoils, suspecting that Lucan isn’t what he appears to be. Lucan calls forth the soul blade from his glove of storing. Combat begins as the guests and servants panic, scream, and attempt to fl ee.

Rather than using the above information literally, gauge the interest level of your players as the masquerade ball unfolds. If the PCs start chatting up party guests with gusto, take to the dance fl oor, or otherwise amuse themselves with the ball’s diversions, let this continue as long as they’re having a good time. Adjust the times in the above sequence of events to give them as much time as they need. 

 

Once the fi ght starts, the party is over. Go to “A Fight Breaks Out,” below. Until then, the PCs can interact with the party as they please. They may engage in some or all of the following activities.

## Ask Guests about Neya or Lucan

Guests and servants start out with indifferent attitudes. If a PC asks a guest to point out Neya or Lucan, have the PC make a DC 5 Persuasion check to try to change the guest’s attitude to friendly. A friendly guest doesn’t point out Neya or Lucan directly, but instead provides a descriptive clue, such as “Neya is wearing a mask with gold feathers” or “That Lucan fellow has diamonds running down the creases of his sleeves and he’s wearing a single leather glove on his right hand. Quite striking, actually.” A PC who presses can obtain a second clue, but no guest will put up with an interrogation. A character who presses too hard changes the guest’s attitude to unfriendly, and the guest starts asking questions in turn, such as “Why are you curious about Neya?” and “Who are you, again?”

## Search for Neya or Lucan

The combination of poor lighting, outrageous costumes, and masks make this task much trickier than it would otherwise be. It takes a DC 15 Perception check to recognize Neya from a verbal description, and a DC 20 Perception check to recognize Lucan (who is wearing a second disguise under his mask) or to locate his sister Grilsha.

 

It takes 5 minutes to scrutinize everyone in the room. For each clue the would-be spotter knows about Neya or Lucan’s costumes (clues acquired by talking to guests and servants), take 1 minute off the time required to scan the room.

## Talk to Neya

Neya begins the encounter with an indifferent attitude toward the PCs. She makes polite but inconsequential conversation with any PC she meets. If the PCs ask Neya about Lucan, she says she’s never heard the name before, using her Deception skill to cover her surprise over the question. 

 

If the PCs confront Neya more directly or reveal that they aren’t ordinary guests, she becomes annoyed (unfriendly) but curious, probing them for their motives while warning them that they’re in over their heads and should just go back to Sharn. “Leave these games of death and deceit to the experts,” she says. 

 

If the PCs talk to Neya after she has danced with Lucan, her attitude immediately shifts to friendly if they mention Lucan’s name. In this case, her attitude represents her intense curiosity to fi nd out what happened to Lucan rather than warm feelings toward the PCs. Neya does her best to fi nd out what the PCs know, agreeing to a cautious, one-step-at-a-time exchange of information. She reveals Lucan’s past in vague terms, leaving out her own espionage activities, but explaining that her relationship with Lucan goes back a number of years. “He has performed services for me,” she admits, “and I have helped him on occasion.” She absolutely wants to know what the PCs know, so she peppers them with a barrage of questions whenever they tell her something new.

## Talk to Lucan

Lucan has an initial attitude of unfriendly toward the PCs. He listens politely and intently to anything a character says, using his Insight and Perception skills against the PCs’ Deception and Performance skills to assess whether they are who they seem to be. 

 

If Lucan suspects something, or if he recognizes the characters from the battle on the road to Trolanport, his attitude immediately changes to hostile. “Engaging in battle in the middle of a crowded party—especially one at the Aundairian embassy—is unwise. Now, what do you really want?” 

 

He is willing to banter with the PCs, but he won’t agree to any deals they might offer—the soul blade won’t let him. Lucan is smart enough to act interested, however, because it provides clues as to whom the PCs are working for, what their capabilities are, and what they want. 

 

If a PC spends at least 1 minute talking to Lucan, have that character make a DC 10 Insight check. If the check succeeds, reveal that Lucan’s behavior seems strangely stilted, as if he were being infl uenced by an enchantment. The PC senses the infl uence of the soul blade. 

 

If the PCs engage Grilsha in conversation rather than approaching her brother, she waves Lucan over as quickly as possible, and then stands by, alert for danger, while Lucan talks to the PCs.

## Obstacles

The dance of the evening is called the caravan. It’s a dance for couples similar to the tango, with many fl ourishes and lots of movement across the dance fl oor. Anyone with a trained partner can go through the motions passably. A PC who’s good at Perform (dance), however, can really shine. Treat this as a performance, as described on page 79 of the Player’s Handbook. It takes 20 minutes on the dance fl oor to make a signifi cant impression. The PC makes no money doing this, but thereafter earns a +2 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based checks during the remainder of the ball if the performance was great (DC 20) or better. There’s no shortage of willing dance partners of any gender or race.

A bard or some other character with ranks in Perform (sing) or Perform (percussion, string, or wind instruments) can ask the bandleader between songs about sitting in for a song or two. The band members have an initial attitude of indifferent toward the PCs. It takes a DC 7 Persuasion check to convince the bandleader to let the character do a song or two. If the PC succeeds, make a Perform check and consult page 79 of the Player’s Handbook to determine the audience’s reaction. The PC makes no money doing this, but thereafter earns a +2 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based checks during the ball if the performance was great (DC 20) or better. 

 

The members of the band all work for House Thuranni’s Shadow Network. They watch and listen for information to pass along to their superiors. None of the band members does anything overt, but they could be working with Areyndee if you want (see the “Who Kicks in the Door?” table on page 3).

This activity requires no checks, but the food is tasty and the champagne fi zzy. PCs seeking more exotic drinks can request them at the bar. Drinks are free.

## Rewards

There’s one in every group, isn’t there? A DC 20 Sleight of Hand check is suffi cient to separate a guest from a coin purse or some of the jewelry he or she is wearing, and the typical guest has a Spot modifi er of +1 on attempts to notice the theft. However, would-be thieves take a –4 penalty on any Sleight of Hand check during the ball because so many bystanders are closely examining each other. A character who gets caught triggers a cry for the guards. 

 

A successful attempt yields the following loot (roll d%): 

01–50, 2d12 gp; 

51–75, 2d6 pp; 

76–90, jewelry worth 1d4××100 gp; 

91–100, jewelry worth 2d4××100 gp.
