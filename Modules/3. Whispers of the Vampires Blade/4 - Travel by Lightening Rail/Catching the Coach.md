# <center>Catching the Coach</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Outdoors

**Encounter Type**: Combat

After getting through the night in Sterngate, the PCs must be aboard the lightning rail coach before it departs in the morning. Lucan reached the station ahead of the PCs and was able to secure a private cabin on the coach. 

 

The PCs must get on the lightning rail before it departs after the sun rises. To do that, they have to get past the surprises Lucan left for them on the station.

 

The platform where the lightning rail coach is parked is basically a rectangle 120 feet long and 40 feet wide. The middle two passenger carts (carts 5 and 6 on the Lightning Rail Coach map, printed on the inside cover) line up along the long edge of the platform, with additional carts stretching to each side. A set of boarding stairs between the two carts welcomes passengers from the platform onto the coach. 

 

Lucan has left a few opponents to hinder the PCs. Two dominated House Orien human fi ghters (who normally serve as station guards) and two bat swarms provide the challenge in this encounter. In addition, the PCs don’t have a lot of time to cross the platform before the lightning rail coach begins to move. 

## Setup

As the PCs enter the station, Lucan spots them from his hiding place and commands the coach driver (whom he also dominated) to depart now.

(He did not make the coach leave earlier than scheduled, since that would have raised questions with offi cials at stops all along the way.) Have everyone roll initiative. The human fi ghters and the bat swarms move to intercept the PCs. At initiative count 10 in each round, the lightning rail coach gets closer to leaving the station, as described below.

## Challenge

Starting in round 3, each PC must make a DC 5 Jump check to leap onto the moving coach and a DC 8 Dexterity check to hang on. Failing either check sends the character crashing to the platform (1d6 points of damage). 

 

In round 6, the DCs increase to 8 for the Jump check and 12 for the Dexterity check. Characters already on the coach can use the aid another action to assist with the Dexterity check. After round 6, the lightning rail coach increases to its cruising speed of 30 miles per hour. If the PCs didn’t get aboard, they’ll have to figure out a way to catch the coach somewhere along its path.
