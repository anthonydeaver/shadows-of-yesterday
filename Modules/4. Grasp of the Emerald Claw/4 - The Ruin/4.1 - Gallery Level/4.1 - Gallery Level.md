## Overview

This structure served as a temple and arcane laboratory for a variety of giants during the height of the Age of Giants. In addition to giants, elf and drow slaves and magehands also occupied the place, serving their giant masters. Other than a few remaining hints, this information may be hard to impossible for the adventurers to learn, and in any case such details arenâ€™t important for the purposes of this adventure.
