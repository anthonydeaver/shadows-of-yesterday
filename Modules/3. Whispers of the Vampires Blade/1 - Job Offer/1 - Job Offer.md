## Overview

This adventure begins in Sharn. If you ran Shadows of the Last War, it starts a few days after the PCs have returned to the city. Lady Elaydren thanks the adventurers for accompanying her and disappears into the shadows of the metropolis. If this is where you are starting the story, don’t worry about any references to past events.

Part One of the adventure consists of the following events: 

- The adventurers receive a mysterious invitation that promises monetary rewards and a job for those who deal in swords and spells. 
- To get the job, the PCs must capture a dire ape that’s loose in a tower garden.
- If the PCs capture the monster and pass the test, Captain Viorr Maelak of the King’s Dark Lanterns explains the situation surrounding the rogue agent Lucan and offers the PCs the job of pursuing Lucan as agents of the King of Breland.
