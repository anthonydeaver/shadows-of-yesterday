The motivations and reasons for the renegade dragon working with the Aurum can add depth and intrigue to the story. Here are several possible explanations:

1. **Desire for Power:** The renegade dragon could be driven by a lust for power and believes that harnessing the obelisk's magic and recreating the Mark of Death would grant them unprecedented power and influence over Eberron.
    
2. **Revenge:** The dragon might hold a deep-seated grudge against a particular faction, nation, or group in Eberron. They see the Aurum's conspiracy as a means to exact revenge on those they blame for their past grievances.
    
3. **Misguided Belief:** The dragon might have been convinced by the Aurum that recreating the Mark of Death would serve a greater purpose, such as restoring balance to the world or preventing a perceived future catastrophe. They genuinely believe their actions are for the greater good.
    
4. **Coercion:** The Aurum might have some form of leverage or control over the renegade dragon, such as holding a loved one hostage or having access to knowledge that could harm the dragon's interests or reputation.
    
5. **Shared Goals:** The renegade dragon could share some ideological goals with the Aurum, such as a desire to reshape the political landscape of Eberron, and sees this alliance as an opportunity to advance their agenda.
    
6. **Ambiguity:** Initially, the dragon's true motivations could be shrouded in ambiguity, and the party must work to uncover the reasons behind the dragon's collaboration with the Aurum.
    

The actual reason can be tailored to fit the overall narrative and the themes you want to explore in your campaign. It can also be revealed gradually as the story unfolds, adding layers of complexity and moral dilemmas for the players to navigate.
