# Additional Spelljammer Tables

## Shipboard Tasks

During the uneventful part of a voyage, the captain of a spelljamming ship can put crew members to work in several ways. If a character is looking for a job to do, or if a captain wants to keep a character busy, roll on the Shipboard Tasks table to determine what needs to be done. The time it takes to complete a task is at least 1 hour, and certain tasks might take longer at your discretion.

##### Shipboard Tasks

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Scrape barnacles off the hull.                                                                                                          |
|  2  | Scrub pots and dishes in the galley.                                                                                                    |
|  3  | Chop vegetables in the galley.                                                                                                          |
|  4  | Swab the deck or sweep the cargo hold.                                                                                                  |
|  5  | Update the ship's navigational charts, which requires cartographer's tools.                                                             |
|  6  | Repair the captain's favorite pair of boots, which requires cobbler's tools. (A *mending* spell also does the trick.)                   |
|  7  | Repair superficial damage to the ship, which requires carpenter's tools or woodcarver's tools. (A *mending* spell also does the trick.) |
|  8  | Compose a new chantey, which requires a musical instrument.                                                                             |
|  9  | Entertain the crew with tall tales or gossip.                                                                                           |
| 10  | Fix the captain's broken spyglass, which requires jeweler's tools or tinker's tools. (A *mending* spell also does the trick.)           |
| 11  | Teach the captain the basics of a language they don't already know.                                                                     |
| 12  | Prepare a tasty dinner for the captain's table, which requires cook's utensils.                                                         |

## Ship Quirks

Roll on the Ship Quirks table if you want to add a bit of "personality" to a ship.

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|  2  | The excessive creaking of the hull echoes throughout the ship.                                                                                   |
|  3  | Any creature that removes itself from the ship's *spelljamming helm* receives a startling but harmless magical shock.                            |
|  4  | The ship's companionways are smaller than those found in most other similar vessels.                                                             |
|  5  | The ship makes a groaning sound in what seems like defiance whenever it comes to a stop.                                                         |
|  6  | The floor of the main deck is adorned with a stylized rendering of a mysterious star chart that pulsates occasionally with scintillating colors. |
|  7  | The ship's air envelope has a salty, briny smell.                                                                                                |
|  8  | Bulkheads throughout the ship have lines of poetry scrawled on them.                                                                             |
|  9  | Unattended tools often go missing, only to reappear 1d4 hours later in another part of the ship.                                                 |
| 10  | A creature seated in the ship's *spelljamming helm* hears faint spacefaring chanteys in its mind except when the ship is under attack.           |

## Ship Cargo

To randomly determine what's in the cargo hold of a spelljamming ship, roll 1d6 times on the Cheap Cargo table and 1d4â€“1 times on the Expensive Cargo table. A duplicate result indicates that the ship has more of the same cargo.

If a cargo container is locked, at least one crew member (typically the captain) has the key to it. A character can try to unlock a container using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.
