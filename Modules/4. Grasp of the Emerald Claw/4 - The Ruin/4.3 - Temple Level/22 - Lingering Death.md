# <center>22 - Lingering Death</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Indoors

**Encounter Type**: Puzzle

**Light**: Pale illumination from the lingering magical effect of the trap.

**Sound**: Strong necromancy (trap on door in southeast corner of chamber).

**Aura**: None

## Setup

An ancient trap slaughtered a squad of Emerald Claw soldiers in this chamber shortly before the adventurers arrive.

Â 

When the adventurers approach this chamber, read:

A semicircle spray of bodies, body parts, and bits of Emerald Claw tabards surrounds a closed iron door in the southeast corner of this large and otherwise empty chamber. A gangrenous radiance illuminates the bodies, rising like dissipating mist from the mutilated forms.

## Challenge

The trap, after thousands of years, has come to the end of its ability to recharge, though it can affect one additional creature before its necromantic power completely fades. The luminescence still clinging to the Emerald Claw soldiers has no effect other than to serve as a warning, and it fades over the course of a few hours. Besides being closed (with all the trouble needed to open a closed giant door), the door is locked (Sleight of Hand DC 11).

## Obstacles

A squad of five Emerald Claw soldiers attempted to gain entry into the door in the corner of the chamber as they went about theirsearch of this level of the ruin. Unfortunately for them, a deadly trap protected the door. The trap is still in place when the PCs enter the chamber, but it only has enough arcane power remaining to affect a single target.

## Rewards

Should the PCs bypass or deactivate the trap and open the door, they discover dust free chamber. A pedestal in the center of the chamber serves as a reliquary of one of the ancient giants that lived in the ruin. The reliquary holds a single giant-sized tooth: the Tooth of At-Ta-Ir.
