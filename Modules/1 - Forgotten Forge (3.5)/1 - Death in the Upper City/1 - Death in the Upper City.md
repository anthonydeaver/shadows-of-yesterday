# <center>1 - Death in the Upper City</center>

## Overview

This adventure begins as the PCs wander the skybridges and tower balconies of [[Sharn]]â€™s upper city after dark. They could be purposely on their way to a specific location, or they can be exploring the high towers with no distinct destination in mind. Then, as so often happens to adventurers in [[Sharn]], they stumble across a dead body.
