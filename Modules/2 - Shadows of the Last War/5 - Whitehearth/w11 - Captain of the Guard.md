# <center>w11 - Captain of the Guard</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

A locked metal door, accessed by a brown keycharm, leads to the richly appointed quarters of Whitehearthâ€™s captain of the guard. A large ironbound chest is set against the foot of the bed. On the right side of the room, a massive bronzewood wardrobe engraved with Elven symbols stands against the wall. In the far corner, an array of swords hangs from a rack on the wall, along with a shield bearing the House Cannith seal and a beautiful blueenameled chain shirt.

## Challenge

The wooden chest is unlocked. The wardrobe is sealed with an average lock, and the bronzewood can absorb a significant amount of damage (40 hp, break DC 26, Open Lock DC 10). The true treasures are sealed in a hidden compartment in the base of the wardrobe. Finding this compartment requires a DC 15 Perception check.

## Rewards

The weapons rack includes a [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/items/greatsword|greatsword]], a [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/items/longsword|longsword]], a shortsword, a steel [[d - Shield|shield]], and a masterwork [[Chain shirt|chain shirt]]. The wooden [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/items/chest|chest]] contains an assortment of blankets and traveling clothes. The wardrobe contains boots and clothing. The secret compartment in the base of the wardrobe contains a purse holding 25 gp, a ring of silver and jet set with an oval-cut bloodstone (worth 100 gp), two vials of [[Silversheen|silversheen]], and a red [[Keycharm|keycharm]].
