## Key People, Places, and Things

Garrow, Lucan Stellos, Grilsha Stellos, Viorr Maelak, Neya ir'Krell

## Storyline Elements

Part One: [[1 - Job Offer|Job Offer]]: This adventure begins in [[Sharn]]. If you ran [[2 - Shadows of the Last War|Shadows of the Last War]], it starts a few days after the PCs have returned to the city. Lady Elaydren thanks the adventurers for accompanying her and disappears into the shadows of the metropolis. If this is where you are starting the story, don’t worry about any references to past events. Part One of the adventure consists of the following events: 

The adventurers receive a mysterious invitation that promises monetary rewards and a job for those who deal in swords and spells. 

To get the job, the PCs must capture a [[Dire Ape|dire ape]] that’s loose in a tower garden. 

If the PCs capture the monster and pass the test, Captain [[Viorr Maelak]] of the King’s [[Dark Lanterns]] explains the situation surrounding the rogue agent Lucan and offers the PCs the job of pursuing Lucan as agents of the King of [[Breland]].

Part Two: [[2 - Trolanport Masquerade|Trolanport Masquerade]]: Let the PCs make whatever preparations they want, just so long as they’re on their way within the hour. On the magebred horses, the PCs can cover 50 miles per day of travel. Lucan has about an eight-hour lead on the PCs (one day of normal travel), and he pushes so that his coach covers about 80 miles per day. It’s about 800 miles along an Orien trade road from [[Sharn]] to [[Trolanport]], traveling along the southern edge of the King’s Forest before crossing the Trolan River and reaching the gnome city. That means, if all goes well, it takes Lucan ten days to reach[[Trolanport]]. But it doesn’t go well. Lucan has trouble getting a new team of horses while he’s still two days out from [[Trolanport]]. He’s just getting back on the road on the twelfth day as the PCs catch up with him. (It takes the PCs sixteen days to make the trip if they travel at a normal pace of eight hours per day. If they decide to push their mounts, they will have to replace them after four consecutive days of accelerated travel.)

Part Three: Sky Raiders of Eberron

Part Four: Travel by Lightening Rail

Part Five: [[5 - Lucan's Last Stand|Lucan's Last Stand]]

## Background

The end of the Last War hasn’t brought an end to the rivalry between the nations of Khorvaire. Every nation spies on its neighbors, and some say the Last War never really ended—only the method of confl ict changed. Now the nations compete through cloak-and-dagger escapades instead of outright battle.

 

Far beneath the towers of Sharn lies a crypt with a resident who, though dead, still wields infl uence in the City of Towers. Calderus is an ancient psionic vampire of fell power who rules a network of enslaved vampires and dominated pawns. This network serves as the eyes, ears, and hands of Calderus; she rarely leaves her hidden crypt. A month ago, an enterprising agent of the Citadel of Breland named Lucan Stellos discovered Calderus’s spy network and traced it back to its source. That was Lucan’s last mistake as a human—Calderus easily defeated the interloper and turned him into a vampire.

 

After interrogating Lucan, Calderus sent her new minion on his fi rst mission. She ordered him to steal a mysterious magic sword from one of the Citadel’s vaults. Lucan succeeded, slaying several guards in the process, but once again found himself in over his head. The soul blade Lucan stole had an intelligence and will of its own, and it quickly conquered Lucan’s will. The soul blade intends to return to the place it was forged—the nation of Karrnath. Neither the soul blade nor Lucan has any qualms about leaving a trail of bodies in their wake as the two of them make their way to the distant nation.

 

Before Lucan became a vampire, he was respected and well known in the spy trade. Lucan was skilled at bringing enemies of King Boranel to justice and thwarting the plots of Breland’s rivals. His sudden departure—and the violence that ensued—didn’t go unnoticed, and spy networks across Khorvaire wonder whether Lucan has gone insane, has betrayed his king and country, or has instigated a new game of death and deceit whose rules haven’t yet become clear.

 

Rumors about Lucan abound, however. Most of the covert and intelligence groups working in central Khorvaire believe that Lucan left the Citadel of his own accord, and some have heard whispers that he took an item of great power with him when he departed. Now those other groups want to get their hands on Lucan— both for the item he supposedly possesses and for the wealth of knowledge he has accumulated over the years. 

 

The King’s Dark Lanterns, the intelligence branch of the Citadel that Lucan worked for, examined the bodies and interviewed the witnesses that Lucan left at the vault. For this reason, they know something that none of the other factions do—that Lucan appears to be more than human. They have no idea how he came to this state, the nature of this state, or what plans drive him, however, and this disturbs them. 

 

Deep in the bowels of Sharn, Calderus is likewise perplexed. It shouldn’t be possible for Lucan to fl ee from Sharn instead of bringing the soul blade to Calderus, since the bond between vampire master and vampire spawn requires total obedience. But Lucan has somehow disregarded this bond, and the vampire lord’s fury simmer

## Additional Details

This adventure follows the events in Shadows of the Last War and is intended to serve as the next part in a longer epic. However, it can be played on its own without any reference to the events that took place in either The Forgotten Forge (presented in the EBERRON Campaign Setting) or Shadows of the Last War. 

 

Over the course of the two earlier adventures, the PCs helped Lady Elaydren d’Cannith recover two schemas and the creation pattern they belong to after braving ancient ruins deep below Sharn and defeating agents of the Lord of Blades and the Order of the Emerald Claw. Both of these groups continue to play a role in the events that unfold over the course of this adventure.

## Concluding the Adventure

When Lucan is captured or defeated, the adventure ends. If there’s a wooden stake in his chest, Lucan is completely inert and won’t pose problems on the return trip. Viorr pays with no complaints, although he’d like to “debrief” the PCs fi rst. 

 

If it meets the needs of your overall campaign, you can of course make the PCs’ lives more difficult. Perhaps one of the PCs tries to use the soul blade. You might have some “A Guy Kicks in the Door” encounters left. Or, the Emerald Claw can hound the characters on the way back to Sharn. 

 

Viorr and Neya might turn up in future adventures as patrons, allies, or enemies, and Garrow, Scimitar, and even Lucan could return. 

 

Finally, Whispers of the Vampire’s Blade plants some seeds for future adventures. How will Calderus react to the capture or destruction of Lucan? Are there unexplored parts of the ziggurat beyond the collapsed hallway? What about the plot involving the schemas? It’s your campaign—do with these seeds what you will.
