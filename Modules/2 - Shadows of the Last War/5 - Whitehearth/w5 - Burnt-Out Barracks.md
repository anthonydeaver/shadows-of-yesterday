## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

This room once served as the living quarters for those working in the Whitehearth facility. Now only hints of the tables, beds, bookshelves, and bodies stick up from among the charred remains. The raging fi res of the living fl aming sphere that uses this chamber as a lair have destroyed almost everything of value. Other features of this location are described below.

## Setup

**Light**: Four weakened everbright lanterns provide shadowy illumination. If the living fl aming sphere is present, it provides bright illumination.

**Sound**: If the living fl aming sphere is present, the PCs can hear crackling fl ame.

**Reaction**: The living fl aming sphere moves to attack any living intruders.

## Participants

**Tactics:**: The sphere attempts to engulf the nearest opponent, maintaining contact until its fi re damage destroys him.

## Rewards

The roomâ€™s contents have been reduced to ash by the living fl aming sphere.
