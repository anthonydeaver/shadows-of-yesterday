# <center>14 - Stairs down to Gallery</center>

## Overview

**Type**: Waypoint

This staircase connects down to area 3 in the gallery level. A human-sized staircase is carved into one side of the otherwise giant-sized stairs. If the adventurers make noise or otherwise make their presence known, the Emerald Claw soldiers in area 15 sound the alarm.
