# <center>1 - Final Boarding Call</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Encounter Type**: Skill Challenge

This encounter is essentially a race against time—can the PCs get past Lucan’s minions and board the airship before it casts off from the docking tower? The docking tower is an 80-foot-tall structure. A winding staircase leads up through the tower to the upper-level docking platform. Six docking berths radiate from the central platform. Only one airship is moored at the dock on this evening, and rarely do the citizens of Trolanport ever see more than two airships at the tower at any given time.

**Light**: Night; everbright lanterns marked on map provide bright illumination for 60 feet.

**Sound**: The PCs can automatically hear the fi ery rumble of the elemental bound to the airship as it prepares to power the vessel.

**Reaction**: Once combat begins on the dock, the airship’s crew begins to cast off. This process takes 6 rounds.

## Setup

This encounter takes place at Docking Berth 3, where Cloud’s Destiny is moored and taking on its last passengers and cargo before departing. Use the map of Docking Berth 3, printed on the inside cover, when running this encounter.

## Participants

Crew Tactics: Other than crouching and ducking, the airship’s crew doesn’t get involved in the fi ght on the platform. It’s not their concern, and getting involved only puts the safety of the ship—and its on-time departure— at risk. The crew has an initial attitude of hostile toward any entreaties for aid the PCs might make. They are noncombatants, and immediately begin casting off when violence begins.

Minion Tactics: The minions follow their orders, concentrating their attacks on whoever is closest to the gangplank. First they try shooting the PCs from a distance, and then attempt to fl ank any PC who makes a break for the gangplank. Remember to make use of the gnomes’ Combat Refl exes feat, which grants them additional attacks of opportunity as PCs try to rush past.

## Challenge

When the characters reach Docking Berth 3, read:

Gnome dockworkers coil up the lines that hold the massive House Lyrandar airship, Cloud’s Destiny, to the tower. A single gangplank connects the airship to the berth’s platform. The airship looks like it’s just about ready to depart. A few of the gnomes stand among the cargo crates that fill the berth between you and the airship. They ready their weapons and move to block your path.

Lucan dominated these gnome minions when he arrived at the docking tower. He ordered them to bar all further access to the airship and remain on guard until after the vessel has departed.

## Obstacles

At initiative count 0 in the fi fth round of the fi ght, the crew retracts the gangplank. Doing this produces a 5-foot gap between the airship and the platform. At initiative count 0 in the sixth round of the fi ght, the airship slides away from the platform, widening the gap to 15 feet. At initiative count 0 in the seventh round, the airship departs. How the PCs perform in this encounter determines which encounter occurs next. If they get aboard Cloud’s Destiny, they start looking for Lucan in “Aboard Cloud’s Destiny,” below. If they didn’t get aboard Cloud’s Destiny, they fi nd unexpected help in the “Need a Ride?” encounter.
