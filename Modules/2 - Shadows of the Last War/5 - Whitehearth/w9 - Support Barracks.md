# <center>w9 - Support Barracks</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

This room served as a barracks for the servants of Whitehearth. Fourteen bunks are spread across the room, each with a wooden chest set at its foot. A round table is set to either side of the door. The awakened dire wolf Rorsa leads the small wolf pack that consists of two male wolves and Rorsa. The pack has claimed this area as its den. When the PCs arrive, Rorsa is here; the two wolves are in W10.

## Rewards

The chests scattered around the room are unlocked. They mostly contain artisan’s outfi ts, artisan’s tools, and other mundane items. A few of the chests belonged to guards. These contain chain shirts, longswords, daggers, and short swords. A total of 30 gp and 80 sp can be found scattered throughout the chests.

## Background

Seven servants were in the barracks when disaster struck. In addition to these corpses refusing to decompose and rot, some arcane aftereffect keeps them in the same state they were in when they died. In this way, the wolves have been able to feast upon the fl esh of the corpses for four years. While the wounds that relate to their deaths never disappear, any damage the wolves cause is repaired within 1d4 hours.

Rorsa and the wolves (originally located in area W10) defend themselves if the PCs attack, but the awakened dire wolf would rather talk than fight. She hails the adventurers when she becomes aware of their presence, greeting them in Common. If the PCs behave in a civilized manner, they can share information with Rorsa. If not, Rorsa calls the wolves from area W10 and attacks.

What Rorsa Knows: Rorsa explains that she remembers very little prior to the moment four years ago when she awoke to full consciousness. All the humans who had cared for her and her kind were dead. She managed to fi gure out how to open the doors and operate the rotator rooms, and she and her friends moved to this wing. She admits to eating the former inhabitants of the base, but points out that they were already dead. And besides, they grow back.

Rorsa wants to hear about the outside world. In exchange, she tells the party about the living flaming sphere in the northeast (W5) and the stone wolf in the southwest (W16). Rorsa has always wanted to find a way to free the rest of the wolves from area W16, but she is frightened of the bizarre creature that guards them. Rorsa asks the adventurers to destroy the stone wolf, and in exchange she promises to give them a green keycharm and her pearl of power.
