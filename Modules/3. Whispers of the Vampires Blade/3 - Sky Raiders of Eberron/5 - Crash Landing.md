## Overview

**Scene Type**: Conclusion

**Setting**: Outdoors

**Encounter Type**: Skill Challenge

This encounter consists of three parts. First, Lucan appears on the deck of the airship. Second, Garrow, spotting the vampire and fearful that he will escape, orders Jade’s Fury to ram Cloud’s Destiny. Third, rammed and extremely damaged, Cloud’s Destiny begins to fall from the sky.

## Participants

At some point during the boarding actions and the battles that result from them, you must decide when you want Lucan to emerge from his nondimensional hiding place. When this event occurs, it triggers the fi nal moments of this part of the adventure. Don’t have Lucan appear too early; wait until the PCs have dealt with most of the invading Emerald Claw soldiers.

If the PCs have gone belowdecks to help the passengers, they can witness Lucan’s appearance. Read:

One of the lockers that line the corridor walls suddenly glows with a discharge of arcane energ y. As the glow dims, the locker door swings open. Lucan steps from the locker, glances at you, and then turns into a thin, gray mist that rises and seeps through a space in the decking above.

If the PCs follow the mist to the airship’s main deck, or if they are on the deck when Lucan appears, read:

Gray mist rises from a space between the deck planks, thickening and taking the form of a man. In a moment, the mist solidifies, and Lucan stands upon the main deck.

Lucan looks around, quickly sizing up the situation. He has the soul blade strapped to his side. He ignores Grilsha if she is still alive and on the airship. She knows his plans and must fend for herself now. If any of the PCs are nearby, Lucan exchanges attacks for a couple of rounds as he moves toward the railing.

## Challenge

### Ramming Speed

Shortly after Lucan appears on the deck of Cloud’s Destiny, Garrow spots him. Furious that his men have not yet captured the soul blade and fearful that Lucan will escape, Garrow increases the speed of Jade’s Fury and sets in on a collision course with the House Lyrandar airship. 

 

Let the PCs make DC 15 Perception checks to notice the fast-approaching airship. If any characters notice the airship coming straight for them, they have 2 rounds to prepare before the ships collide. If none of the PCs succeed on the Perception check, they continue with whatever actions they have been participating in. At his initiative count in the second round, Lucan uses a standard action to once again take on gaseous form.

At initiative count 0 in that round, Jade’s Fury rams Cloud’s Destiny. Read:

Wood buckles and cracks as the two airships collide. Your vessel shakes and shudders violently as the bow pitches downward. The sound of shattering deck planks and splitting rigging explodes into the night. As the ships merge in ways no builder ever imagined, the elemental binding housings rip apart. In addition to the terrible damage inflicted by the colliding vessels, now each ship’s elemental—one fire, one air—emerge to battle amid the disintegrating vessels that once held them.

The PCs must make DC 20 Dexterity checks or get thrown to the split and cracking deck beneath them. Those who fail take 1d6 points of damage. Those who succeed maintain their footing and grab hold of something more or less stable as the airship rocks and begins to fall from the sky. Just as the disaster occurs, Lucan, in gaseous form, fl oats away from the two airships. Between the damage infl icted on both ships in the crash and the damage being caused by the two warring elementals, both vessels are going down. What the PCs do next determines how much damage they take in the imminent collision with the ground.

### Fall From the Sky

Have the PCs roll [[3. - Initiative|initiative]] so you can keep close track of time. Have each player point out exactly where on the ship his or her character is. The airships hit the ground at [[3. - Initiative|initiative]] count 0 in the fourth round thereafter. When they hit, the crash deals 12d6 points of damage to each individual aboard unless the PCs can somehow slow the descent. 

 

The PCs can attempt to commandeer a skiff. (The skiffs are very slow, capable of traveling only 2 miles per hour.) They can use whatever magic is available to them to attempt to protect themselves or the falling ships. They can enter the nondimensional space where Lucan had been hiding; it endures the crash without any harm coming to those within it. 

 

In the end, the two airships smash to the ground. Both sustain such damage that neither will rise again without extensive repairs. [[Garrow]] slips away in the confusion; he always has a contingency plan for escaping. Lucan (and Grilsha, if she survives) also gets away. 

 

The airships crash within sight of the fortress of [[Sterngate]]. This Brelish outpost has a lightning rail station. As luck would have it, a lightning rail coach heading north toward [[Thrane]] prepares to depart in the morning. The PCs can rest in the wilderness outside the fortress, or they can request that the gates be opened so they can make use of the fortress’s inn.

[[Sterngate]]: The fortress-town protects the pass between [[Darguun]] and [[Breland]], as well as serving as a way station for travelers going to or coming from [[Zilargo]]. The PCs can easily convince the guards to open the gates, even though it is well after dark, if they show the guards the traveling papers that Viorr provided them with in [[Sharn]]. In addition to the lightning rail station and an inn, the PCs can stock up on supplies and make use of the services of the resident House Jorasco healer. Any other survivors from Cloud’s Destiny also make their way to [[Sterngate]]. The Jade’s Fury survivors disappear into the night.
