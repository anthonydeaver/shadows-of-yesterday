## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

This double chamber is similar to area W6. It contains a pool of fresh water and a row of latrines. Rorsa’s companions, two wolves, rest in here when the PCs enter this wing, occasionally taking lazy laps of water. If the PCs reach this location without alerting the wolves or Rorsa to their presence, the wolves become confused at the sight of living humans. They bark and howl to get Rorsa’s attention and then attack the intruders.

If Rorsa is attacked, they immediately go to her aid. If Rorsa commands them to stop, they reluctantly do so as long as the PCs stop making hostile actions.
