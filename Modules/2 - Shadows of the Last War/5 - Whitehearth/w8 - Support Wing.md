# <center>w8 - Support Wing</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

This corridor, accessed by a blue keycharm, leads to the living area of the facility’s support staff. Servants, guards, and laborers were housed in this wing.

## Setup

A corridor of plain gray stone extends ahead of you. In the flickering light from the dim everbright lanterns embedded in the walls, you see a few trails of crusted blood running along the floor, as if someone was dragged down the corridor. At the far end of the hall you see three portals: an open archway to the left, a door propped open straight ahead, and a sealed metal door to the right.

**Light**: Weakened everbright lanterns provide shadowy illumination.

**Sound**: Any PC who makes a successful DC 5 Perception check can hear splashing water and indistinct yaps and growls from area W10.

**Reaction**: If the PCs make noise or otherwise alert her to their presence, Rorsa appears in the doorway of area W9 and initiates conversation.

## Background

While members of the common races died on the Day of Mourning, other creatures were affected in different ways by the arcane storm that raged across Cyre. Two guard wolves, led by an awakened dire wolf named Rorsa, have claimed this wing as their own. Rorsa has learned to manipulate the keycharms with her teeth, and her pack has access to water and meat—in the form of corpses located throughout the facility.

The wolves have keen ears. As the PCs move down the corridor, make two Perception checks (+8 modifier for Rorsa, +6 for her wolf companions). If the wolves hear the approaching adventurers, Rorsa appears in the doorway of area W9 and hails the party. Refer to area W9 for details.
