# <center>4.1.5 - Stairs up to Dark Level</center>

## Overview

**Type**: Stairs
*annotation:* This staircase leads to the Landing on the dark level of the ruin. When the adventurers approach this staircase, read:

Slabs of stone form a giant-sized staircase that leads higher into the ruin, but a narrow, humanoid-sized staircase is cut into one side.

Creatures at the top of the stairs on the Landing below may hear characters who ascend these stairs, depending on how cautious the PCs decide to be. If the creatures hear the approaching PCs, they prepare an ambush.
