## Overview

**Type**: Room
*annotation:* The giant door leading from area 4 to this area is stuck fast and can only be broken open (break DC 35).

If this chamber is accessed, it is found to be empty except for a layer of ancient dust. The door to Savage Deity is sealed and must be forced open or broken if the PCs want to access the next chamber.
