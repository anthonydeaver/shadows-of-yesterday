The party confronts Kethril and his allies in a final battle, which takes place on Kethril's flagship in the midst of a fleet battle.

During the battle, it is revealed that Kethril's true plan is to use the artifact to power a powerful weapon that can destroy entire worlds, which he plans to use to conquer the universe.

The party defeats Kethril and his allies, but the artifact is damaged in the battle and begins to malfunction.

The Church of the Platinum Dragon arrives to take possession of the artifact, but as they do, the artifact explodes, creating a massive portal that sucks in everything in the immediate area.

The party wakes up, safe but confused. They soon learn that the explosion created a portal that led to a distant part of the universe, and that they are now stranded there.

However, they are now stranded in a distant part of the universe and must find a way back to Eberron. The Church of the Platinum Dragon is grateful for their help, and offers to assist them in any way they can.
