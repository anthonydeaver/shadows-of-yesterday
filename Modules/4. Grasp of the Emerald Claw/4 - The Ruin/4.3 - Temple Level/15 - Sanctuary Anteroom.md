# <center>15 - Sanctuary Anteroom</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Transition

**Setting**: Indoors

**Encounter Type**: Subterfuge

## Setup

Two Emerald Claw soldiers guard the doors that lead into the temple sanctuary. Unless the adventurers take precautions, the soldiers hear or see their approach and raise the alarm. If the adventurers specifi cally attempt to move quietly, not use a light source, or take some similar precaution, then have the soldiers make Perception checks.

 

When the PCs reach the top of the stairs, they see the following. Alter the description if the soldiers are aware of their approach. Read:

Massive double doors of stone and rusted iron stand partially open to the north, the walls to th east and west each contain a closed. [Two uniformed men stand guard to either side.] Light spills from the between the open doors.

## Challenge

This place served as an anteroom, a purification chamber prior to entering the main sanctuary to the north.

A portion of the Emerald Claw task force explores area 16, looking for clues on how to activate the Throne Gate on the observatory level. Two soldiers guard the anteroom, watching for drow warriors or wandering creatures.

 

These soldiers have only one task—to note intruders and give warning to those in the sanctuary (area 16). After shouting their warning, the soldiers fall back to join their associates in the larger chamber.
