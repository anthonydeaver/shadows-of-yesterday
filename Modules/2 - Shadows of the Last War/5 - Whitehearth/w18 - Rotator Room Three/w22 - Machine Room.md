# <center>w22 - Machine Room</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Underground

**Encounter Type**: Combat

This chamber contains the eldritch machine that destroyed [[Rose Quarry]], as well as the second schema and the [[creation|Creation]] pattern the schema belongs to. The eldritch machine, wrecked and no longer working, appears as a terrible multiheaded construct rising from a crucible of molten glass. The danger here comes not from the machine, but from two fire elementals that were once bound to it and now wander the chamber freely.

## Setup

**Light**: Bright illumination is provided by the two fire [[Elementals|elementals]] and the crucible of molten glass; dim everbright lanterns provide shadowy illumination in the rest of the chamber.

**Sounds**: No Perception check is necessary to hear crackling fl ames and the bubbling of a pool of molten glass.

**Reaction**: If the doors are opened, the fire [[Elementals|elementals]] move to attack.

This large chamber stretches away from the doorway, and intense heat shimmers in the air. A raging bonfire burns about 40 feet away, near the far wall, casting dancing shadows across the room. A second one burns about 60 feet away, along the southern wall. In the center of the room, a large crucible filled with bubbling molten glass radiates terrible heat. Long, snaking heads made of iron and brass rise up from the molten pool like some metal hydra. Just south of the crucible and the construct, a crystalline chest reflects the hot light. Through the translucent material, you can see that the chest contains a variety of objects, including what can only be the diamond-shaped schema that you seek. Then, with an angry crackle of flame and a threatening hiss of steam, the bonfires begin to move toward you.

***Fire Form.*** The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.



***Illumination.*** The elemental sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light in an additional 30 feet.



***Water Susceptibility.*** For every 5 feet the elemental moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.



**Actions**


---



***Multiattack.*** The elemental makes two touch attacks.



***Touch.****Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:* 10 (2d6+3) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

***Ancestral Protectors.*** Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, when you rage spectral warriors appear to help you. While raging, the first creature you hit with an attack becomes the target of these spectral warriors. The spectral warriors hinder the creatures attacks. Until the start of your next turn, the target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when they hit a creature other than you with an attack, that creature is granted resistance to the deamage dealt to that single attack. The effect on the target ends early when your rage ends.



***Consult the Spirits (1/short rest).*** At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you can cast either the augury or the clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or any material components. The clairvoyance spell does not creat a spherical sensor, instead summoning an invisible ancestral spirit to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. 
After you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.



***Spirit Shield (1/round).*** Starting at 6th level, the ancestral guardians can provide protection to those you defend. If you are raging and another creature within 30 feet of you that you can see takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 2d6 points.
The damage reduction increases to 3d6 at 10th level, and by 4d6 at 14th level.

The damage reduction increases to 3d6 at 10th level, and by 4d6 at 14th level.



***Vengeful Ancestors.*** At 14th level, whenever your Spirit Shield reduces damage from an attack, the attacker suffers an equal amount of force damage in retaliation.

## Obstacles

The fire elementals that were bound in the eldritch machine are free and wandering the chamber. They have no desire to be returned to their prison. The [[Elementals|elementals]] believe that the party has come to restore the binding spells, so they attack without mercy. If the dome in the ceiling is opened, the [[Elementals|elementals]] stop fighting and seek to escape from the facility.

## Rewards

The Crystalline Chest: In front of the ruined eldritch machine sits a large chest formed of a heat-resistant crystalline substance and sealed with an average lock (40 hp, DC 10, Open Lock DC 10, resistent against fire damage). The treasure contained within could play a critical role in the characters’ surviving the encounter.

The translucent chest contains two copies of the diamond-shaped schema (the original and an exact copy created by the Whitehearth artificers), 2 potions of resistance (fire), 2 potions of greater healing, 1 scroll of resistance (fire), and the Xen’drik creation pattern. The pattern is a large disk formed of adamantine and covered with mithral-laced runes and symbols. It contains sockets for four schemas, like the ones found beneath Sharn and in the chest. It is 3 inches thick, 2 feet across, and weighs 10 pounds. 

## Background

This chamber houses the eldritch machine that destroyed [[Rose Quarry]]. Using the [[creation|Creation]] pattern discovered in Xen’drik and one schema, the artifi cers of [[5 - Whitehearth|Whitehearth]] developed the hydra-headed eldritch machine that spat white-hot molten glass from its fi ve heads to rain upon the helpless village. They tested it just before the event that destroyed the rest of [[Cyre]] occurred, not sure exactly what the machine was going to do. Overjoyed and a little horrifi ed by the powers of the machine, the artifi cers were in the process of shutting it down when the [[Day of Mourning]] swept across the land. The eldritch machine was damaged, and the fire elementals bound within it were released. Due to the damage and the uncooperativefire elementals, this machine will never work again.

Anyone who examines the ceiling notices a retractable dome directly above the machine. Controls for opening the dome can be found in the southern alcove nearest the doorway. A successful DC 15 Use Magic Device check or a DC 20 Knowledge (arcana) check allows a character to fi gure out the controls and open the dome. If the dome is opened while the fire elementals are still alive, they immediately break off [[9 - Combat|combat]] and fl ee through the opening into the bleak Mournland countryside.

Terrible heat fi lls the chamber, emanating from the pool of molten glass. If the PCs choose to stay in the chamber for an extended period, they need to worry about severe heat damage (see page 303 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).
