# <center>20 - Temple Ledge</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Ruin

**Encounter Type**: Combat

**Light**: Daylight (if any)

**Sound**: Padded animal feet and scrabble of claws on stone (DC 12 Perception check)

## Setup

The temple level is open to the elements, and a 20- foot-wide ledge runs around the outside of the ruin. A group of dire apes has claimed the ledge as part of its hunting territory. Green vines cover the ledge and hang from the stone above, and nearby jungle foliage grows close by.

 

When the adventurers approach this area, read:

A ledge provides a path around the outside of the ruin at this level. At a height of about 150 feet above the ground, the view is spectacular. A light wind blows, scented with jungle odors. The great concavities carved into the side of the stone all along the ledge act like great ears, bringing faint sounds from the animals far below into sharper focus.

## Participants

The dire apes use area 21 as a lair. They hunt in the jungle and along the ledge, but they also consider the ledge to be part of their lair and so actively work to protect it from intruders. If the adventurers step onto the ledge, there is a chance every round that the nearest duo of dire apes notices them with a Perception check.

## Challenge

A total of six dire apes roam the ledge, but they wander in pairs. During the day, two dire apes can be found on three of the four sides of the temple, walking the length of the ledge and then turning the corner to patrol the next side. At night, a single pair wanders the ledge while the rest of the troupe rests in area 21.

If the adventurers intrude on the ledge and are noticed by a pair of dire apes, the dire apes roar and move in to drive off or kill the invaders. After a confl ict starts, the roars and the sounds of battle attract another pair of dire apes in 1d4+1 rounds. After the second pair appears, another arrives in 1d4+1 rounds. Arriving pairs start out at the corner of one side of the ledge upon which the original battle began. 

 

If possible, dire apes attempt to position themselves to bull rush PCs off the ledge. If a dire ape succeeds in this action, the PC falls 150 feet (15d6 damage). 

 

Battles on the south ledge attract the troupe leader from area 21 in 1d4+1 rounds.
