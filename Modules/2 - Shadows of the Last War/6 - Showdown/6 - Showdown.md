## Overview

After the PCs defeat the fire elementals and recover the schema (both the original and the copy) and the creation pattern, they can leave [[5 - Whitehearth|Whitehearth]] without incident. They can either leave through the open dome above area W22, or they can backtrack to the mine above area W2. Depending on how things went with [[Rorsa]] and her pack, they might try to fi nd a way to get the wolves out of the facility as well. One last encounter awaits the adventurers. [[Garrow]] and his [[Emerald Claw]] soldiers have followed the PCs to [[5 - Whitehearth|Whitehearth]] and wait to ambush them when they exit.
