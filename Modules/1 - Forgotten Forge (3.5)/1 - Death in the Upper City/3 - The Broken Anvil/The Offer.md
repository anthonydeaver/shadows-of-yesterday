## Overview

**Date**: 01/01/20000 BCE 00:00:00

[[The Broken Anvil]] is a small tavern located in the Mason’s Tower. A sign above the door indicates that the establishment belongs to House Ghallanda. Inside, the halfl ing matron welcomes them and leads them to a secluded table near the back of the common room. “My Lady,” the halfl ing says to the woman already seated at the table, “your guests have arrived.” Read the following text aloud:

The [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/races/human|human]] female in the dark blue cloak has delicate features, dark blue eyes, and sleek black hair bound with silver and turquoise ornaments. She wears a signet ring of [[House Cannith]] on her right ring finger and speaks in a soft but clear voice. “Thank you for coming. We have important business to discuss that relates to the unfortunate death of Bonal Geldem. Please, sit down.”

This is Elaydren d’Vown of [[House Cannith]], a cousin of the blood but not an heir. She points to glasses and three pitchers—ale, wine, and water—then gets right to business.

“I have been working with Provost Geldem to recover a family heirloom,” Lady Elaydren explains. “We were to meet earlier tonight, but as you know, he never made it. I learned from the Watch what had transpired, and so sent one of my men to track you down.”

She continues. “The heirloom, according to family legends, was locked away in a foundry that dates back to pre-Galifar [[Sharn]]. Poor Bonal believed he discovered the location of the foundry in an ancient [[House Cannith]] journal. I was going to fund an expedition to go to the site, but without Bonal . . .” Her voice trails off. Then she leans close. “Perhaps you would be willing to recover the heirloom for me. For a generous reward, of course.”

## Story

At this point, Elaydren either gives the PCs the ancient journal (if they didn’t take it earlier) or asks them to produce it (if they did). Her signet ring and the mithral threads on the cover glow in unison as she takes hold of the small book. When she opens it, the blank pages immediately begin to fi ll with delicate script and line drawings. She turns to a specifi c page, studies it for a moment, and then pulls a folded map from inside her cloak.

“The location of the lost foundry is deep within the Dorasharn Tower,” Lady Elaydren proclaims. “Fifty-seven levels below the tower’s present-day sewer system. I offer you one thousand gold pieces and the good will of my house if you recover the heirloom and return it to me. Will you help me?”

## Background

Lady Elaydren belongs to the [[House Cannith]] family in [[Aundair]]. However, she secretly works for Baron Merrix d’Cannith of [[Sharn]]. He wants the schema, but Elaydren doesn’t know why he wants it or what the relic does. She just knows that he wants his interests in the relic to remain hidden. She provides the PCs with 100 gp up front to outfi t their expedition, but won’t give them the rest of the 1,000 gp until they return with the relic. She provides a map that Bonal created showing the sewer system and the path into the depths of the Dorasharn Tower.

“The relic I seek is an adamantine plate in the shape of a seven-pointed star about the size of your hand,” Elaydren explains. “It has no special power by itself, but is an ancient schema—a piece of a pattern used by the Cannith artifi cers of old to craft unusual items. Recover this piece of history for us, and [[House Cannith]] will be extremely grateful.”

## Additional Details

Who killed Bonal Geldem? “A servant of the Lord of Blades. The warforged prophet wants the schema for his own dark purposes.”

Why don’t you seek the help of the local house? “[[House Cannith]]’s leadership has been disjointed since the destruction of [[Cyre]]. I am loyal to the leader of my portion of the family, which operates out of [[Aundair]]. I have nothing against the [[Sharn]]-based family, but I am here to further the efforts of Baron Jorlanna d’Cannith of [[Aundair]].”

How do we reach the lower levels? “This map shows the way to reach the sewers of the Dorasharn Tower. Somewhere beyond the E-213 Valve Cluster you’ll fi nd a sealed door with the same mark as the one on Bonal’s journal. Open the seal, and the tunnel beyond will take you to the longforgotten level far below, where the foundry resides.”

Are there any dangers we should be aware of? “Other than the Lord of Blades, who may have other agents seeking the schema, who knows what lurks in the hidden places beneath the city? Now that I think about it, Bonal did say that he would defi nitely need to bring fi re on the expedition. I wonder what he meant? Anyway, I urge caution, but I am completely confi dent that you can handle anything you may encounter in your search.”

If the PCs tell her about the fi nal messenger, she looks troubled, then says that the Lord of Blades most defi nitely is aware of the situation
