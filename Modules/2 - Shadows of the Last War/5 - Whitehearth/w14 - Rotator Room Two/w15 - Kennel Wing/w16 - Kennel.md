## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

Eleven steel cages line the walls of this kennel, and gray wolves occupy seven of the locked cages. Ever-fi lling containers within the cages keep the wolves fed and watered. When the PCs enter this chamber, or when the stone wolf reveals itself, read:

## Setup

This creature has the shape of a wolf, but plates of black marble have been fused to its flesh. In addition to the stone armor that shields its flanks, its muzzle has been replaced by an elongated maw filled with row upon row of obsidian teeth.

## Rewards

A pile of garbage includes a few odds and ends collected from the wizards and artificers who died. This pile includes an orange [[Keycharm|keycharm]], an essence of the scout, a [[House Cannith]] signet ring, and a small mithral-and-bloodstone brooch depicting a crescent moon (worth 130 gp).

## Background

This stone wolf is the result of Whitehearth experiments to combine fl esh and construct characteristics. Now this half-golem wolf guards the kennel and attacks anyone who enters the area—wolf and human alike.
