# <center>w1 - Mineshaft</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Underground

**Encounter Type**: Exploration

## Setup

**Light**: This portion of the mine is completely dark.

**Sound**: The PCs can’t hear any unusual sounds.

**Reaction**: Nothing animate or alive occupies this location; instead, traps protect the area and discourage further investigation.

## Challenge

The Situation: In each of the snaking tunnels, a circular, 4-foot-wide adamantine hatch is set into the fl oor. There is a simple locking mechanism at the center of the hatch, and a small socket just to the left of the locking mechanism, coated in blue enamel. The socket is designed to fit a blue keycharm such as the one that Lady Elaydren placed in the handy haversack. If the keycharm is placed in the socket, the hatch unlocks without any difficulty. Otherwise, any attempt to open the hatch triggers a deadly trap.

## Obstacles

Traps: Each hatch is rigged with a [[Shocking Grasp|shocking grasp]] trap that activates if someone tries to open it without using the proper keycharm. 

 

[[Shocking Grasp]] Trap: CR 3; magic device; touch trigger; automatic reset; spell effect ([[Shocking Grasp|shocking grasp]], 9 (3d6) electricity damage); [[3 - Investigation|Investigation]]/[[Find Traps]] DC 13; Disable Device DC 13.

## Background

Developments: Things are not always what they seem. The hatches marked as “a” on the map are decoys. When these hatches are opened, a second shocking grasp trap is triggered. The hatch marked “b” opens onto a circular metal shaft with a metal ladder running down one wall. A wall of darkness, the edge of the Mordenkainen’s private sanctum effect, conceals the bottom of the shaft. The shaft descends 30 feet, leading to area W2.
