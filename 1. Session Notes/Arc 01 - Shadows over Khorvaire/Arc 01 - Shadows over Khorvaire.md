The adventure begins with the party meeting their employer, a wealthy merchant named Trask, who has hired them to find a lost planet that he believes holds a powerful artifact of great value. Trask provides the party with a Spelljammer ship and a map that he claims will lead them to the planet.

The journey takes the party through the vast expanse of wildspace, where they encounter various dangers and obstacles. They may encounter pirates, hostile aliens, or treacherous nebulae that pose a threat to their ship. They may also have to deal with equipment malfunctions, supply shortages, or other challenges that arise from being in space.
