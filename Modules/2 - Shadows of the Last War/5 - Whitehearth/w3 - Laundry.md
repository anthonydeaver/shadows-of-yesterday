## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

This corridor, accessed by a blue keycharm, leads to a laundry room. At fi rst, it might appear to be a vast linen closet. A narrow corridor runs between four rows of fl oor-to-ceiling shelves, with fresh bedsheets, blankets, towels, and clothing stacked high upon them. The room is completely free of dust, and the pleasant smell of clean cloth fi lls the air. At the far side of the room, a large washbasin is set into the fl oor. If the PCs watch, a clean white tunic fl oats out of the basin, folds itself, and stacks itself on a shelf. 

This room showcases a domestic experiment. The washbasin uses a limited form of prestidigitation to clean any object placed within it, and it also generates a permanent unseen servant to handle the chores of cleaning. 

## Setup

Creatures: The unseen servant ignores the party, even if it is attacked. If the servant is destroyed, the washbasin automatically manifests a new servant in 1 hour.
