## Synopsis

In Sharn, the City of Towers, the adventurers are again called upon to help Lady Elaydren d’Cannith. This time, in addition to appealing to their desire for gold and adventure, Elaydren describes a desperate situation involving the schemas and the Order of the Emerald Claw. The adventurers arrive to fi nd that Lady Elaydren’s domicile has been trashed and the lady herself left for dead. Agents of the Emerald Claw have raided her sanctuary and stolen the two schemas and the creation pattern. 

 

Fearful that her secret master, Baron Merrix, will be angry with her for losing the items, Elaydren sends the adventurers to recover the stolen materials. With the completed creation pattern, she explains, the Order of the Emerald Claw will gain power beyond anything imaginable. The order can’t be allowed to succeed, she warns, or the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses themselves could fall. 

 

She also reveals that the Emerald Claw has taken notes recently uncovered in one of the House Cannith libraries—notes made by Kedran d’Cannith around the time of the War of the Mark that suggest where the last schema is hidden. The notes imply that the fourth schema lies in ruins on the mysterious continent of Xen’drik. “Hurry,” Elaydren urges the characters. “You must follow the Order of the Emerald Claw to Xen’drik and recover the schemas at all costs.”

 

Elaydren provides the adventurers with information, traveling papers, and passage on a new vehicle developed by Cannith for use by the intelligence agencies of the Five Nations—an undersea ship. During the trip to Stormreach, sahuagin raiders attack as the undersea ship wends its way through Shargon’s Teeth. 

 

In Stormreach, investigation produces results: A group of armored soldiers arrived in a privateer airship, asked questions about the deep jungle, and then went into the jungle following the Rachi River. The adventurers’ best option for following them is to hire a riverboat. After a trip into the wilderness of Xen’drik, the adventurers reach the ruin where the last schema waits. Dark elves and other dangers must be dealt with before the adventurers enter the ruin for the fi nal confrontation.

 

At the heart of the ruins, a giant-sized living construct that predates modern warforged by several millennia guards the last schema. The primitive warforged must be overcome, along with Garrow and the remnants of the Claw task force, as well as Scimitar, an agent for the Lord of Blades who has formed a temporary alliance with Garrow to make sure that the creation pattern is completed. 

 

And what of the Xulo Pattern? Once all of the pieces come within close proximity of each other, the ancient intelligence awakens. Suddenly all parties have a new and powerful enemy to contend with. . . .

## Using this Material

Grasp of the Emerald Claw follows the events of the Eberron adventures “The Forgotten Forge,” Shadows of the Last War, and Whispers of the Vampire’s Blade. If you did not run these adventures, don’t worry; Grasp of the Emerald Claw is a stand-alone adventure that can be run for characters without firsthand experience of the other adventures. The previous events could have happened through the actions of another party of adventurers, and now Lady Elaydren turns to your group to finish the job that started weeks ago with the murder of Provost Bonal Geldem of Morgrave University. If this is your first foray into this series of adventures, you should still work out that Lady Elaydren is one of your adventuring party’s patrons prior to running Grasp of the Emerald Claw.
