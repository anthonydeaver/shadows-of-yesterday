# <center>5 - The Mouth of the Mine</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

Eventually, the PCs reach the location that corresponds to the spot on the map from [[Rose Quarry]]. When they reach this area, they fi nd what appears to be an abandoned mineshaft dug into a low hill. Before they can enter the shaft and make their way into the Whitehearth facility, they must deal with [[Garrow]]’s spy and pet, the vulture zombie

## Setup

At the base of a low hill, a timbered opening leads into a dark tunnel. At first glance, it looks like any other abandoned mineshaft. Then, with a more careful inspection of the opening, you spot the House Cannith seal emblazoned on the center crossbeam.

This is indeed the entrance to the secret Whitehearth facility. Garrow, watching through the undead eyes of the vulture zombie perched on a nearby withered tree, experiences joy and anger at this moment. He is happy that his plan worked and that the adventurers have led him to Whitehearth, but he feels a raging anger that they might get to enter the installation before he does.

Let the PCs examine the entrance as they see fi t. Other than the House Cannith seal, nothing indicates the nature or purpose of this mine. No traps or alarms are present at the entrance, and the tunnel stretches into darkness. As the PCs set up a marching order to enter the 10-foot-wide tunnel, Garrow orders his vulture zombie to attack.

If the PCs noticed the vulture following them earlier, they can each make a DC 12 Spot check. Anyone who fails the check is caught by surprise as the rotting vulture swoops down from the sky.

**Light**: Depending on the time of day, the Mournland is bathed in perpetual twilight or the darkness of a cloud-covered night.

**Sound**: The area around the mineshaft is quiet. A successful DC 20 Listen check allows a PC to hear the occasional rustle of the nearby vulture zombie’s skeletal wings.

**Reaction**: If a character approaches the entrance to the mine, the vulture zombie attacks.
