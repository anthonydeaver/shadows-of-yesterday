# <center>1 - Forgotten Forge</center>

## Overview

This adventure takes place in [[Sharn]], the City of Towers. It begins, as many incidents in the City of Towers do, with a corpse. A [[Warforged|warforged]][[Assassin|assassin]], a mysterious blank book, and an offer from a [[House Cannith]] heir leads the adventurers into the depths of [[Sharn]]—eventually to an ancient ruin dating back to before the creation of the Kingdom of [[Galifar]].

 

Along the way, if the adventurers are successful, they recover a lost schema—a part of a pattern used by artifi cers to craft magic items. They also learn that many different agencies are interested in this relic, including those loyal to the various House Cannith elders and agents of the infamous Lord of Blades.
