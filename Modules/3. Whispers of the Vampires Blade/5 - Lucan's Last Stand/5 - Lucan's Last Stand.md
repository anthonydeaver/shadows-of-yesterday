# <center>5 - Lucan's Last Stand</center>

## Overview

Lucan has struggled to take control over his destiny since becoming a vampire. First, he came under the thrall of the vampire lord Calderus. Then, the soul blade exerted infl uence over him. Now, with pursuers closing in on him, Lucan has temporarily asserted his will and taken control of himself. He doesn’t know how long this will last, but he desperately wants to once again be in charge of his own fate. 

 

Lucan didn’t want to become a vampire. He didn’t want to betray the Citadel. He certainly didn’t want to go to Karrnath. Now, in a moment of clear thought and lucidity, he has decided to cast off the orders of unseen masters and make his own stand in the Thrane wilderness. 

 

After fl eeing from the lightning rail coach, Lucan heads toward the ruins of an ancient goblin ziggurat. Here, the vampire prepares to battle the PCs who have been tracking him since Sharn.
