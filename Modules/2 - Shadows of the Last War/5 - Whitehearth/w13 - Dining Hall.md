# <center>w13 - Dining Hall</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

This corridor, accessed by a brown keycharm, leads to the dining hall. Four long tables are set up around the main room, and an archway on the far wall leads into a large kitchen. Ten humans—seven men and three women— died in this hall. These corpses are warm to the touch, and rigor mortis has not set in; they seem to be sleeping, but they can’t be awakened. The kitchen contains a well fi lled with pure water, cabinets fi lled with pots and pans, a wine rack with an assortment of vintages, and various other cooking utensils. A large ebony cabinet with multiple drawers and complex mithral patterns inlaid on its surface rests against one wall. Each drawer produces a particular prestidigitation effect, either chilling, heating, or fl avoring food.

## Rewards

Among the bodies, the PCs can recover 9 blue keycharms, 2 brown keycharms, 20 sp, and 10 gp.
