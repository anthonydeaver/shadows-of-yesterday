- **Introduction:** The PCs begin as ordinary residents of Sharn, leading their daily lives. Each character has their own occupation and connections in the city.
- **Mysterious Events:** A series of strange and unsettling events occur in Sharn, including unexplained magical disturbances and a rising number of disappearances.

**Airship Chase Sequence:**

- While investigating the mysterious events in Sharn, the PCs come across information indicating that the Aurum has hired a powerful airship to transport valuable cargo, which they suspect is related to the obelisk.
- The PCs decide to intercept the airship to gather more information and potentially thwart the Aurum's plans. They might need to secure their own means of aerial transportation, such as commandeering a smaller airship or hiring a crew.
- The chase begins as the PCs' airship pursues the Aurum's vessel through the skies of Sharn. It's a high-stakes aerial pursuit filled with obstacles, challenges, and opportunities for creative problem-solving.
- During the chase, the PCs might encounter enemy agents, face dangerous aerial hazards, and attempt daring maneuvers to gain the upper hand.
- The climax of the chase occurs as the PCs board the Aurum's airship, leading to a mid-air confrontation with the enemy agents and uncovering clues about the obelisk's location and significance.
- The chase sequence ends with the PCs either securing the information they need or narrowly escaping from the Aurum's grasp. It's a thrilling action set piece that propels them deeper into the mystery.

After the airship chase, the adventure proceeds with the PCs continuing their investigation into the conspiracy, ultimately leading them to Xen'drik in Act 2. This addition not only adds excitement but also provides the players with a memorable and dynamic encounter in Act 1 of the adventure.
