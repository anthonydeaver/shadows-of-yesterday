## Overview

**Type**: Room

This corridor, accessed by an orange keycharm (but only after fi rst disarming the trap by using a red keycharm, as detailed in area W18), leads to the chamber where the schema is stored.

On the far wall, the PCs see a pair of adamantine doors bearing the seal of House Cannith, and waves of heat pour off the doors and ripple through the corridor.
