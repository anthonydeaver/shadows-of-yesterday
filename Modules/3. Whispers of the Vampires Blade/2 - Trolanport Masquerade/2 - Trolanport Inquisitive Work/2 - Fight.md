## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Urban

**Encounter Type**: Combat

During the PCs’ investigation, a group of sahuagin muggers try to sneak up on them, slipping out of the canal when the PCs enter a narrow side street or alleyway. Trolanport is battling an epidemic of sahuagin-related crime right now, and the PCs might get drawn in if they’re not careful. The sahuagin normally live farther out in the ocean, but a small band has braved Trolanport in search of food and plunder.

[[Sahuagin]] Tactics: The [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] try to sneak up on the PCs through the canals. Then they move into flanking position against an individual PC if possible, attacking with their tridents and talons. If reduced to below 5 hit points, a [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] tries to dive into the water and escape into the murky depths.

## Additional Details

If the PCs want to get further involved in trying to defuse the sahuagin threat, Trolanport offi cials can hire them to locate and drive out the sahuagin band. A total of eight sahuagin are in the band, which hides in an underground cave near the port canals.
