## Overview

Once the PCs learn that Lucan has passage aboard a House Lyrandar airship, they need to hurry to reach the docking tower across the city. The docking tower is a tall structure where an elemental airship can moor, exchange passengers and cargo, take on supplies, and then disembark without ever touching the ground. 

 

The docking tower rises above the rest of the structures in Trolanport and can be seen from almost anywhere within the city. The PCs can’t trail Lucan and Grilsha (if she escaped the masquerade along with her brother), but they can rush toward the docking tower. House Lyrandar controls and operates the tower. The characters reach the tower in time to see fi nal preparations being made for the departure of an elementalpowered airship. 

 

In this part of the adventure, the PCs must get aboard the Lyrandar airship before it departs or fi nd another method for following Lucan to Karrnath. An attack occurs about twenty-fi ve hours into the air journey, resulting in the probable crash of the airship.

The Lyrandar Airship: The airship Cloud’s Destiny is one of the elemental-powered vessels in House Lyrandar’s small but growing fl eet. It leaves from the Trolanport docking tower at this late hour for the fi ftyhour trip to Starilaskur. After a day at the Brelish city, the airship continues on to Korth. The second leg of the trip takes about thirty-seven hours, at which time the airship makes a stop in Flamekeep, the capital of Thrane. The following day, the last part of the voyage takes place, a fi fteen-hour trip to Korth in Karrnath. Of course, this all depends on an uneventful trip. The PCs’ trip is anything but uneventful.
