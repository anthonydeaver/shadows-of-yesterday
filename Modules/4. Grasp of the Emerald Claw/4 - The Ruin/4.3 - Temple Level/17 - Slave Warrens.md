## Overview

**Scene Type**: Transition

**Setting**: Indoors

**Encounter Type**: Investigative

## Setup

The elves that worked for the giants were housed in this section. Little remains from those ancient days. Read:

These rooms are far smaller than the other chambers. The entryways between the rooms, too, seem built to accommodate smaller, more human-sized frames. All that remains are drifts of dust.

## Rewards

Thirty minutes and a DC 15 Investigation check unearths a solid mass of silver coins (all stuck together) worth 1,000 sp, and a jade statue of a panther (worth 500 gp) from the dust.
