# <center>21 - King of the Apes</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Indoors

**Encounter Type**: Combat

## Setup

At night, the dire apes lair in this chamber. The leader of the troupe, a girallon, however, is always here. Read:

The giant-sized door to this chamber is stuck halfway open. Within, the stench of unwashed animals is overpowering. Piles of furs and wide leaves gathered from the surrounding jungle dot the chamber. Many animals obviously use this place as a den. As you glance around, a nearby shadow moves and a white gorilla with four arms emerges from the darkness with a menacing roar.

## Challenge

A girallon leads the troupe of dire apes that lair within this chamber. The dire apes that wander the high faces of the ruin by day can be found here at night.

If the adventurers approach this chamber during the day, the girallon is present. Dire apes arrive in pairs, beginning 1d4+1 rounds after a battle begins, and 1d4+1 rounds after each new pair arrives. If the adventurers approach this chamber at night, four dire apes and the girallon are present, and the remaining pair of dire apes arrive 1d4+1 rounds after a battle begins. In all cases, the girallon and dire apes attack intruders.

## Rewards

A search through the refuse reveals 160 ancient pp, 6 emerald gems worth 100 gp each, and one dusty rose gemstone shaped like a prism (an ioun stone).
