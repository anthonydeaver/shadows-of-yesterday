1. **Double Agent:** One of the party's allies or a seemingly innocent NPC traveling with them turns out to be a double agent working for the Aurum. They've been feeding information to the enemy and could betray the party at a critical moment.
    
2. **Betrayed by Dragons:** The dragon guardians who initially helped the party reveal a hidden agenda. They are not as altruistic as they seemed and have their own reasons for seeking the obelisk's power. The party must decide whether to trust or confront them.
    
3. **Deceptive Fragments:** Some of the obelisk fragments the party recovers turn out to be clever forgeries or decoys planted by the Aurum. The real fragments are hidden elsewhere, leading to a wild goose chase and a race against time.
    
4. **Sympathetic Antagonist:** An antagonist within the Aurum or one of the thieves begins to doubt the morality of their mission. They approach the party in secret, offering valuable information and assistance to thwart the conspiracy from within.
    
5. **Parallel Conspiracy:** It's revealed that there is another group or faction with interests in the obelisk and the Mark of Death. They might have their own agenda, which could align with or oppose the party's goals.
    
6. **The Marked One:** One of the party members discovers they have a latent Mark of Death, and their abilities could be used to manipulate or control the obelisk. This revelation complicates their role in the story and raises questions about their true purpose.
    
7. **Time Constraints:** The party learns that the Aurum and dragons are closer to completing the ritual than initially thought. There's a ticking clock, and they must make critical decisions and sacrifices to stop the ritual in time.
    
8. **Manipulated Memories:** The party encounters a group of individuals who claim to be witnesses to the original Mourning. They suggest that the obelisk's secrets are not what they seem and that the history they know may be a manipulated version of the truth.
    
9. **Divine Intervention:** A divine entity or powerful outsider takes an interest in the party's mission. They offer guidance, artifacts, or cryptic prophecies that could either help or hinder the party's progress.
    
10. **Illusionary Threat:** The party is led to believe that the obelisk's power is far more destructive than it actually is. Their pursuit of its destruction might have unintended consequences or lead them down a morally complex path.
