# <center>4.1.7 - West Antechamber</center>

## Overview

**Type**: Room
*annotation:* The giant door to this area can be pushed open farther (DC 15 Strength check), but it is already open just far enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through with a DC 10 Dexterity check.

## Description

If the PCs enter this area, read:​

A wide track mars the ancient dust that covers the floor. The stone shows actual ruts, revealing the passage of many human-sized feet over hundreds of years. The track leads straight across the room. 

 

The track leads to another great door opposite the first. Sheaves of edible leaves, pottery, wine-filled vessels, and cuts of rotting meat are piled near that door, as if in offering. Several of the vessels are tipped and smashed.

## DM info

Smaller creatures can slip through without a problem, but larger creatures must open the door wider. The chamber is dark, and the light from the doorway only illuminates a small portion of it. The PCs must have a light source to examine the entire chamber. 

The drow believe that an envoy of their god lives beyond the door, and they brought daily offerings to it prior to the arrival of the Emerald Claw task force, piling them against and around the door.
