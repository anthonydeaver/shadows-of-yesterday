# <center>3 - Abandon All Weapons Ye Who Enter Here</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Encounter Type**: Subterfuge

The PCs learn that “Krell” is a person, not a place or an object. Neya ir’Krell is a high-ranking diplomat in the Aundairian embassy. Indeed, although the PCs don’t know it yet, she works for the Royal Eyes of Aundair, the intelligence agency that serves the Queen of Aundair. It seems that the diplomat is hosting a high society function at the embassy tonight—a masquerade ball designed to entertain and to provide an environment where various covert transactions can occur. One such transaction involves Lucan and the ambassador. She plans to provide Lucan with traveling papers and letters of passage that will get him safely and discreetly to Karrnath.

**Light**: Everbright lanterns provide bright illumination to the grounds around the embassy and the area around the doors.

**Sound**: Murmuring of crowd noise and music from the party inside the embassy (automatic).

**Reaction**: To actual combat or an attempt to rush inside the embassy, 1d4 embassy guards arrive to make arrests in 3 rounds (automatic). See statistics for embassy guards below.

## Setup

This encounter consists of the PCs trying to gain entry to the Aundairian embassy.

## Participants

Guard Tactics: These guards are provided to the embassy by the Trolanport government, and they’re eager to do their jobs well because diplomatic assignments tend to be pretty cushy and they’d like to be offered this kind of assignment again.

## Challenge

This encounter is essentially a test of wits—the PCs have to get past the guards at the door to crash Neya ir’Krell’s party. When the PCs enter the grounds of the Aundairian Embassy in the evening, read:

Blinking magical lights created by gnome entertainers guide you through the Aundairian Embassy’s courtyard toward a set of heavy wooden doors. Beyond the doors, you hear the sound of music and laughter. Two gnomes in full plate with hooked hammers at their sides stand on either side of the doors. A box full of white paper sits next to their feet. “Welcome to the Night of a Thousand Stars. Invitations, please,” one gnome says glumly.

## Obstacles

The guards won’t let in uninvited guests, and they won’t let weapons or those wearing medium or heavy armor into the ballroom, either. (See below for more information about the rules of the occasion.)

For a guest to get past the door, he or she must meet three conditions:

Each guest must have an invitation. “Whether you lost it or not, we were specifically told to make no exceptions,” say the gnomes. The guards collect invitations from each guest upon entry, and then drop them into the box at their feet. The invitations are identical; they don’t mention names. (If the PCs stick around for fi ve minutes or so, they see the gnomes scrutinize an invitation, drop it in the box, and open the doors for a guest.) 

 

The PCs can get an invitation by sneaking one out of the box, either with a mage hand spell or with a DC 10 Sleight of Hand check. The gnomes get Perception checks (DC 5 to spot mage hand, and a DC equal to the check result for Sleight of Hand) to notice what the PCs are up to. Another guest shows up in the courtyard every five minutes or so, and it’s certainly possible to use Sleight of Hand or more violent methods to get invitations from guests as they arrive.

Guests must surrender weapons and any obviously dangerous magic. The gnomes look the PCs over, and they automatically notice any weapons the PCs haven’t taken pains to conceal. The guards explain that they’ll happily check weapons in the guardhouse, and the PCs can retrieve them when the party ends. The guards also look askance at obvious magic items such as glowing staffs, brightly shining helmets, and so forth. They ask what the item does, and then warn the PCs that casting spells inside the ballroom is against the law.

 

If a PC tries to sneak a concealed light weapon past the guards, have the character make a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the guard’s Perception check. This use of the Sleight of Hand skill can be made untrained using the PC’s Dexterity bonus. Daggers provide a +2 bonus because they’re easy to hide, and PCs wearing heavy or bulky clothes get a +2 bonus as well. If the PC succeeds, the guard’s don’t notice the weapon. If the PC fails, the guards notice the weapon and bar the character from entry. The PCs can also use spells such as invisibility or shrink item to get a weapon into the ballroom. 

 

The guards believe anything the PCs tell them about nonweapon magic items, as long as it’s even slightly plausible. Magic isn’t their area of expertise.

Guests must be properly attired. At a minimum, this means a noble’s outfit, and most of the guests are dressed in clothes fit for royalty. Characters who aren’t up to the dress code are sent to a seamstress a few blocks away where they can buy noble outfits (75 gp), royal outfits (300 gp), or masquerade costumes (100–500 gp, depending on how gaudy and fanciful the costume is). 

 

Another part of the dress code is that shields, medium armor, and heavy armor are forbidden. “We’re at peace, sir, haven’t you heard?” say the gnomeguards. The guards happily check armor and shields in the guardhouse, and PCs can pick such items up after the ball ends.

A final aspect of the dress code requires that all guests be masked. The guards can provide simple domino-style masks for PCs who “forgot” to bring their own. 

 

PCs who don’t have the right clothes can either make a quick shopping trip or use illusion magic such as [[Disguise Self|disguise self]] to trick the guards. Glamered armor likewise fools the guards completely.

## Rewards

Award the characters full experience for getting past the gnome guards and into the party, regardless of the method they used to accomplish it.

## Additional Details

If the characters fail in an attempt to steal an invitation, get caught with a concealed weapon, or otherwise make a nuisance of themselves, the guards won’t give them a second chance. The guards threaten them with arrest if they don’t leave. But a change of the guard twenty minutes after the PCs first arrive means the PCs get a second chance if they mess things up the first time. 

 

When the PCs get inside the ballroom, their next encounter is the “Masquerade Ball,” below. 

 

Experience: Award the characters full experience for getting past the gnome guards and into the party, regardless of the method they used to accomplish it.
