# <center>GM Synopsis</center>

## Overview

This adventure sends a party of four 4th-level characters on a mission fi lled with danger and intrigue. When a Brelish spy defects and takes a potent magic item with him, a race ensues to recover both before the fragile balance of power in postwar Khorvaire tips in the wrong direction. With minor adjustments to encounters, this adventure can handle groups of adventurers smaller or larger than four as well.

## Synopsis

The adventure begins in Sharn, the City of Towers. Viorr Maelak, a captain in the King’s Dark Lanterns, hires the characters to apprehend Lucan Stellos, an agent serving under Viorr’s command who has apparently gone rogue. Catching Lucan poses three complications. First, Viorr doesn’t know whether Lucan has fellow traitors within the ranks of the Dark Lanterns. Second, Lucan absconded with one of the Citadel’s most powerful magic weapons, a longsword known as the soul blade. Third, based on the trail of bodies Lucan left behind as he fl ed, it’s evident that Lucan is no longer merely human.

 

The search for Lucan begins in the gnome city of Trolanport, where the PCs seek Lucan’s associates in hopes of uncovering his trail. At a high-society masquerade ball, the adventurers pick up Lucan’s trail while drawing the attention of rival groups also searching for the rogue agent.

 

The PCs pursue Lucan as he fl ees Trolanport aboard an elemental-powered airship. Along the way, raiders hired by the Order of the Emerald Claw attack, causing the airship to crash near Sterngate. At the fortress, Lucan catches a lightning rail coach. After a running battle aboard the fast-moving coach, Lucan fl ees into the Thrane wilderness to make his fi nal stand in a ziggurat that dates back to the Dhakaani Empire.

## Using this Material

This adventure is event-based. It consists of a number of encounters that move the plot—the PCs’ pursuit of Lucan—forward. You control the pacing of the adventure, and you have the freedom to move encounters forward and back in the sequence we’ve provided. 

 

For example, the adventure includes a high-society ball in the city of Trolanport. As written, that ball takes place the fi rst night after the PCs arrive in the city. But if the PCs stagger into Trolanport with grievous wounds and clearly need rest before they resume adventuring, you can have the ball occur three days after the PCs arrive. 

 

In an event-based adventure, you have the freedom to adjust encounters to satisfy the style of the players in your game. For example, if your players enjoy investigations and talking with NPCs, stretch out the scene where the PCs attempt to discover where to fi nd Lucan’s associate in Trolanport, making them work for the information that moves the plot forward. If your players prefer combat, have the sahuagin offer the information the PCs seek while begging for their lives after the PCs defeat them.

### Set Pieces and Cliffhangers

Whispers of the Vampire’s Blade has four set pieces—big, memorable encounters that should feel like the best scenes from an action movie. Specifi cally, the masquerade ball, the battle with the sky raiders, the battle on the lightning rail coach, and the fi nal confrontation with Lucan deserve more of your attention because they’re the encounters your players will be talking about long after the adventure ends. Make sure these encounters get a signifi cant part of your preparation time, and your effort won’t be wasted.

 

The set-piece encounters may take an hour or more each to run, so think carefully about timing in the real world as you run the adventure. You have two options: plan your gaming sessions so that each set piece occurs early in the session, or fi nd a suitably tense moment in the middle of the encounter, and then create a cliffhanger by saying, “See you next week.”

 

For example, you could end a session with the PCs taking off aboard the airship bound for Karrnath; you’ll have plenty of time to run the sky raiders encounter when the game resumes. Or you could start the sky raiders encounter, then end the session at the moment the two airships collide, causing their elemental rings to fl icker and sending them plummeting toward the ground. Your players will have all week to agonize over their characters’ predicament and think of ways to pull their airship out of its dive. 

 

Also consider that D&D characters need periodic breaks to rest, heal, and prepare spells. The set-piece encounters expend as many PC resources as three or four normal encounters, so it’s best if the PCs are near full strength when a set-piece encounter begins. Furthermore, it’s a good idea to give the PCs an opportunity to rest after a set-piece encounter ends.

 

### A Guy Kicks in the Door

To paraphrase author Raymond Chandler, whenever the action lags, have a guy kick in the door and start a fi ght. In this adventure, that guy is almost always someone else pursuing Lucan and the soul blade. Set up a confrontation for the PCs using an NPC from the following list. Choose from the list or roll randomly.

## Additional Material

To get the most out of this adventure, you need copies of the following D&D books: Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, Monster Manual, and the EBERRON Campaign Setting. If the characters have already gone through Shadows of the Last War (the fi rst adventure in a three-part series), this adventure continues that story line.
