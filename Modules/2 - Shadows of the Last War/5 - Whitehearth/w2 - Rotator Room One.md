# <center>w2 - Rotator Room One</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Transition

**Setting**: Underground

**Encounter Type**: Puzzle

## Setup

**Light**: A weakened everbright lantern provides shadowy illumination.

**Sound**: None.

**Reaction**: None; the rotator room is empty.

Dim light, little more than that provided by a flickering candle, emanates from a crystalline globe embedded next to the entrance. This strange metal chamber is a perfect sphere, approximately 20 feet across. The only exit from the room appears to be the shaft you descended. An octagonal metal plate is set into a pedestal at the center of the room. This metal plate is 1 foot across and contains nine socketsâ€”five blue enamel sockets, two green sockets, and two brown sockets.

Initially, the adventurers can only access the areas that correspond to the blue sockets. 

The first time a character selects a blue socket and inserts the keycharm, read:

A powerful vibration shakes the walls of the chamber, and slowly the entire room begins to rotate. You have to move to keep from falling down, but the grooved floor helps you stay on your feet. In less than a minute the chamber has rotated, and now the entryway appears as a doorway into a corridor instead of a hatch in the ceiling.
