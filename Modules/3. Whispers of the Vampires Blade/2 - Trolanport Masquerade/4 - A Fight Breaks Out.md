# <center>4 - A Fight Breaks Out</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Indoors

**Encounter Type**: Combat

At some point, a battle begins—Lucan is identified and attacked, either by the PCs or by Meena. Once the fight starts, the crowd panics. On the map of the ballroom, represent the crowd as four Huge swarms (each covering a 3-square-by-3-square area). Start one crowd on the dance floor, one near the bar, and the other two in the middle of the ballroom. A crowd moves 20 feet toward the nearest exit at initiative count 0 in each round (the guests try to move faster, but they get in each other’s way).

**Light**: Overcast daylight (bright illumination).

**Sound**: Talking, clattering hooves, haggling, water splashing in the canals, and other typical city sounds (automatic), sneaking sahuagin.

**Reaction**: To combat on city streets—8 gnomeguards arrive in 5 rounds. Gnomeguards are 1st level fighters.

***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.



***Spider Climb.*** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.



***Vampire Weaknesses.*** The vampire has the following flaws:
Forbiddance. The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage when it ends its turn in running water.
Stake to the Heart. The vampire is destroyed if a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into its heart while it is incapacitated in its resting place.
Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.



**Actions**


---



***Multiattack.*** The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.



***Bite.****Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:* 6 (1d6+3) piercing plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount.

The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.



***Claws.****Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

*Hit:* 8 (2d4+3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 16).

## Challenge

Lucan and Grilsha Tactics: Lucan and the soul blade are angry that Lucan’s cover has been blown. Grilsha moves to Lucan’s side on her fi rst action and prepares to cast spells that will help them escape. She has invisibility and cat’s grace ready for just this purpose. If combat can’t be avoided, she provides aid as the situation warrants. Lucan snaps his fi ngers and calls forth the soul blade from his glove of storing. He fi ercely attacks whoever attacked him for a round or two, then starts making for the exit. Between the pair, they use children of the night, darkness spells, and invisibility to get away. If Lucan spots Neya during this time, he whirls on her with dreadful anger. Under the assumption that she betrayed him, he rushes to unleash his fury upon her. Grilsha reminds him that time is short, so he won’t stay to fi nish Neya off, but he will try to deal as much damage as he can before he leaves. If the PCs try to defend Neya, they have an easier time of getting information out of her after Lucan escapes.

Royal Eyes’ Agents Tactics: Meena and her two agents attack Lucan as soon as combat breaks out, no matter how it started. The agents engage Lucan in melee combat while Meena uses spells, although many of her enchantments won’t be effective against Lucan. After a round of trading blows, one agent tries to grapple Lucan, only to discover why it’s a bad idea to grapple a vampire—Lucan easily overpowers him and feeds. Once Meena realizes that most of her spells won’t work against Lucan, she turns them on anyone who’s interfering—probably the PCs.

Crowd Tactics: Each Huge swarm of partygoers moves 20 feet toward the nearest exit every round, on initiative count 0. The swarm moves in as direct a path as possible. If the swarm moves over a square occupied by a PC or one of the other combatants, that crowd engulfs that character. The character doesn’t take any damage, but he or she must attempt a DC 10 Dexterity save. If the character succeeds on the save, the crowd moves on, leaving the character where he is. (The save must be attempted each time a crowd moves over a character’s square, so it is possible that a character will have to make multiple saves in the round.) If a character fails the save, he or she becomes part of the swarm and moves with it. On the character’s turn, he or she can attempt a new Dexterity  save; if the save succeeds, the character breaks free and can move normally. If a character rolls a natural 1 while making a Dexterity  save against the crowd, he or she falls prone. A prone character takes 1d6 points of damage each time the crowd-swarm moves over his or her square.

Guard Tactics: The embassy guards aren’t exactly clever tacticians; they simply fi re crossbows at anyone who’s fi ghting, fi guring that it’s easier to sort these things out once everyone is shackled. They use their gnome hooked hammers only if pressed.

## Obstacles

At least two separate groups have come to the masquerade ball to capture Lucan—the PCs (working for Breland), and Meena and her agents (working for Aundair). Neya ir’Krell, meanwhile, has covered all her bases. She has honored her past commitment to Lucan by providing him with the aid he has requested, while staying loyal to the Royal Eyes of Aundair by alerting them to Lucan’s plans to attend the masquerade. She doesn’t see this as a confl ict. If Lucan gets captured, it was meant to be. If he escapes, then she has returned the favor and provided him with the means to get to Karrnath.

 

 Once Lucan reveals himself and weapons are drawn, the PCs must contend with a number of obstacles. 

 

The fi rst challenge comes from Lucan and Grilsha, who have no intention of being captured by either Aundairian agents or adventurers working for the Citadel’s Dark Lanterns. 

 

The second challenge takes the form of Meena and her two agents of the Royal Eyes. They want to capture Lucan by any means possible, and they have no intention of letting him fall into the hands of a foreign nation. (Neya, on the other hand, steps back to watch events unfold once combat begins. She feels she has done her work in this matter, and in any event she must maintain her cover as a simple diplomat at all costs.) 

 

The third challenge takes the form of the party guests, who move as Huge swarms as they attempt to get out of the ballroom. 

 

The fourth and fi nal challenge comes from the embassy guards, who try to subdue or incapacitate all the combatants in the ballroom.

## Rewards

The goal of this encounter is for Lucan to escape. Grilsha sacrifi ces herself, if necessary, to make sure that occurs. Once he gets out of the ballroom, he uses his alternate form, gaseous form, or spider climb ability to disappear into the night. He can’t be followed. 

 

After the battle, the PCs need to fi nd out where Lucan is going. Neya knows, and she’ll tell the characters if she can talk to them privately, away from Meena or her agents. 

 

Neya pulls rank as a diplomat and dismisses the guards. If the PCs defended her, she feels obligated to help them. If the PCs trade information, telling her something about Lucan that she doesn’t know, she provides details of Lucan’s destination. If the PCs decide to press the issue and threaten to expose or embarrass Neya over this incident, she decides to give them the information if they agree to let her know how this all works out.

Neya Comes Clean: In the end, Neya agrees to help the PCs because Lucan has become a vampire; she feels he tricked her and took advantage of their friendship. Neya tells the PCs that she provided Lucan with a password that grants free passage on a House Lyrandar airship leaving from Trolanport for Karrnath this evening. She also identifi es Grilsha as Lucan’s sister. She provides the PCs with no other aid, other than to tell them they are free to go—despite all the trouble they caused this evening.
