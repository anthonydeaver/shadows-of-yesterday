# <center>16 - Sanctuary</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Indoors

**Encounter Type**: Combat

## Setup

After prying open the massive doors, a small contingent of the Emerald Claw task force entered this sanctuary in search of clues as to how to operate the Throne Gate in area 33.

**Light**: Daylight spell cast on a 5-foot tall pole atop the ziggurat

**Sound**: Sounds of many people working unless the guards gave warning. If the warning was sounded, then the room is almost completely quiet as the task force prepares to deal with the intruders.

**Aura**: Moderate abjuration (lesser globe of invulnerability on top of the ziggurat).

When the adventurers pass (or look) through the opening between the massive doors, read:

The corners of this cyclopean chamber are lost in shadow, but the stone ziggurat set in the center of the 40-foot-tall chamber rises to within 10 feet of that height. A great globe of light, almost like daylight, illuminates the top of the ziggurat. The ziggurat has three steps, each rising 10 feet higher than the previous level. Convoluted designs in carved relief cover every foot of the structure, except for the uppermost step. There, the strange designs appear on three on the four sides, each showing a single glyph. The fourth side is completely devoid of all markings. Several human-sized figures move about the ziggurat, their shadows thrown as huge silhouettes across the walls. Tents, temporary tables, and other camp gear occupy the floor between the base of the ziggurat and the south wall.

## Participants

This sanctuary was important to the giants, and many wondrous secrets of a lost age are encoded upon the stone. A portion of the Emerald Claw task force is assigned here to decipher the glyphs.

Garrow has placed Arkaban, a mummy sorcerer, in charge of deciphering the glyphs in this chamber. Arkaban is a devoted follower of the Blood of Vol and was brought on this expedition because of his expertise in life as an historian of Xen’drik and the Age of Giants. The mummy sorcerer labors here, with the help of Gunfarr Lok and his squad of four soldiers (two start out guarding the door at area 15, while the other two work in this chamber, dealing with any physical labor that Arkaban requires). Arkaban, Gunfarr, and the soldiers attack any intruders.

## Challenge

If the group isn’t aware of the approaching adventurers, Arkaban works at the very top of the ziggurat, attempting to puzzle out the meanings of the glyphs that decorate three of the four sides of the uppermost step. Gunfarr wanders around the base of the ziggurat, occasionally glancing at the glyphs, but mostly appearing bored as he carries out his duty to protect Arkaban. The soldiers wait on the middle step of the ziggurat, ready to perform whatever task Arkaban assigns them. 

 

The occupants take up defensive positions the moment they realize that intruders have entered the sanctuary. Gunfarr prefers to wade into melee. His soldiers start out using their crossbows before resorting to melee combat. Arkaban enjoys the protection provided by the permanent lesser globe of invulnerability that covers the top level of the ziggurat. (The effect is equivalent to that of a 10th-level caster; if dispelled, it returns 1d4 minutes later.) He uses his acid splash and magic missile spells to attack from range for as long as he can. 

 

If the soldiers from area 15 have alerted those in the sanctuary, then the situation starts out a bit differently. The four soldiers take up defensive positions on the second tier of the ziggurat and pepper intruders with crossbow bolts for as long as possible. Gunfarr unloads with his adamantine bolts fi rst, targeting warforged characters if any are present, before drawing his longsword and engaging in melee. Arkaban’s tactics remain the same, though he has already gulped the potion of bull’s strength he carries before the PCs enter the chamber. If things begin to go badly, Arkaban quaffs his potion of invisibility and tries to escape to rejoin Garrow.

## Additional Details

Arkaban knows that information Garrow seeks is imbedded in the ziggurat. According to Garrow’s ongoing divinations, three coordinates of the six needed to properly orient the Throne Gate on the observatory level can be found encoded on this ziggurat. However, Arkaban has just come to the conclusion that a key for reading the glyphs must exist, and he just fi nished issuing the order to search the rest of the temple level when the adventurers arrive. 

 

While Arkaban won’t explain this to the PCs, the common soldiers can be intimidated into revealing their orders (DC 10 Intimidate check), and Gunfarr can be bribed (DC 9 Persuasion check, 250 gp, and his freedom). They have no idea exactly what they are searching for, other than Arkaban believes it can be used to read the ancient glyphs. Without the codebreaker, the glyphs cannot be read. With the codebreaker in hand, the designs on the lower two levels of the ziggurat can be deciphered. They describe a myth of the magician-gods of the giants and a parable of the magehand and the giant’s son, both mostly inscrutable due to cultural differences. The glyphs that decorate three of the four sides of the uppermost step describe three coordinates for the Throne Gate (see area 33). These are three of the six needed to use the Throne Gate to access the resting place of the fourth schema. The glyphs read as: The Monkey’s Paw, the Unicorn’s Hoof, and Io’s Twinkle. A successful DC 25 Intelligence (arcana) check allows a character to recognize these as versions of the names of stars in the sky.
