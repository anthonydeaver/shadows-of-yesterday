# <center>1 - Investigation</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Urban

**Encounter Type**: Investigative

Efforts to find Lucan don’t pan out. [[Trolanport]] is a teeming metropolis, and Lucan’s skill at disguise and subterfuge make it impossible to find him after only a few hours of asking questions.

 

On the other hand, learning about “krell” requires only that the PCs spend 1d4+1 hours talking to people and then make a Investigation check (which can be made untrained and can be retried until a result of 7 or higher is achieved). 

## Rewards

What the PCs learn depends on the result of the successful Investigation check. Read or paraphrase from the information below as appropriate.

Check Result 7-15: “K-R-E-L-L, you say? Well, there’s an Aundairian diplomat here, goes by the name of Neya ir’Krell. There’s some sort of high society function at the Aundairian embassy tonight.”

Check Result 15 or Higher: All of the above, plus a little more. “It’s a masquerade ball, and it’s invitation only. Should be lots of music and dancing—and whatever else diplomats do after the sun sets and the moons rise.”

## Additional Details

The Aundairian Embassy is a massive white marble structure on Trolanport’s Embassy Row. Other than an impeccably maintained courtyard beyond a tall wrought iron fence, very little of it is visible from the canal-street. An overwhelming number of guards are stationed on Embassy Row.
