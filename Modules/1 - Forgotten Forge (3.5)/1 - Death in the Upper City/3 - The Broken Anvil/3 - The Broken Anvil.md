# <center>3 - The Broken Anvil</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

## Setup

After the encounter on the skybridge, the Watch either sends the PCs on their way, or they wind up in a Watch holding cell somewhere in [[Sharn]]. If they were arrested (because they refused to stand down when Dolom ordered them to), they spend about an hour in a locked cell before Dolom opens the gate and lets them out. “You must have friends in high places,”Dolom tells them as he returns their equipment and turns them out.

Shortly after either leaving the bridge or the holding cell, the adventurers are approached by another cloaked fi gure, his hood pulled tight to keep out the rain. He shows them a signet ring with the [[House Cannith]]symbol emblazoned on it.“If you would know the truth of Bonal Geldem’s murder, go to the Broken Anvil tavern at dawn.”Before the PCs can ask questions, the fi gure turns away and quickly disappears into the night.
