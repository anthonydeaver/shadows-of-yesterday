## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Encounter Type**: Combat

The PCs continue their trip through the Mournland toward the Whitehearth facility when they come upon an even more terrible sight than what they encountered around the broken siege engine. They ride (or walk) into the remains of a massive battle. Most of the corpses—Brelish infantry and Cyran archers—died in a battle that took place on the Day of Mourning, four years ago. Mixed in with these older (but still fresh-looking) corpses are the victims of a more recent skirmish. Two days ago, a warband made up of Valenar elves encountered a party of Talenta halfl ing hunters. The two opposing bands fought among the ruins of the older battle until they were surprised by a terrible monster hiding beneath the corpses. The carcass crab emerged and struck quickly and with great ferocity. The halfl ings and elves defended themselves and wounded the monster, but they could not kill it. Now their bodies lie among those that fell on the Day of Mourning.

## Setup

**Light**: Depending on the time of day, the Mournland is bathed in perpetual twilight or the darkness of a cloudcovered night.

**Sound**: The scene is eerily silent. No scent of death or decay is discernible in the air, despite the number of bodies scattered across the field.

**Reaction**: If a character approaches within 20 feet of the mound of halfl ing and elf bodies, the carcass crab emerges from hiding and attacks.
