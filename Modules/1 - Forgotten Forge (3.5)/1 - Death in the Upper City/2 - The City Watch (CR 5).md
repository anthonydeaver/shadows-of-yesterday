# <center>2 - The City Watch (CR 5)</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Outdoors

## Setup

The [[City Watch]] shows up, a bit late, and demands to know what’s going on. This encounter isn’t meant to lead to battle. The offi cers of the [[City Watch]] may give the adventurers a hard time, but it becomes even harder if the PCs decide to fi ght the law. Neither their character levels nor their reputations can help them if they wind up on the wrong side of the Watch, but if they cooperate, the PCs might earn a friend or two in high places.

When the Watch arrives on the scene, read:

Two males and a female, wearing the green-and-black [[Studded leather|studded leather]] of [[Sharn]]’s [[City Watch]], emerge from the rain-drenched night. The leader, a powerfully built bald [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/races/dwarf|dwarf]] with a close-cropped beard, steps forward, leveling his crossbow in your direction. The small ball of arcane light, hovering just above and behind his left shoulder, illuminates the area. To each side, a [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/races/human|human]] male and female stand with halberds at the ready.

 

“Olladra’s bloody nose!” the [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/races/dwarf|dwarf]] curses. “By order of the Watch, drop your weapons and explain yourselves!”

## Challenge

The [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/races/dwarf|dwarf]], [[Sergeant Dolom]], always does his best to see that justice prevails in [[Sharn]]. Unfortunately, he’s a poor inquisitive and usually accepts what he sees at face value. He’s a good person for the adventurers to get on their side. Conversely, he’s a terrible enemy for low-level characters to have.

Dolom demands that the adventurers comply with his orders. If they refuse or try to fl ee, Dolom and his companions attack, calling for additional members of the Watch to hurry to their side. In such cases, 1d4 members of the Watch (see statistics below) show up every 3 [[1. - Rounds|rounds]] until Dolom calls them off or the PCs surrender or are defeated.

If the PCs cooperate and politely answer Dolom’s questions, they have a good chance of gaining the sergeant’s trust. When the [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/races/dwarf|dwarf]] asks the PCs to explain themselves, have the PC that speaks for the party make a Diplomacy check. As long as the PCs behave civilly, witnesses from nearby shops and homes come forward to corroborate their story (the PC making the check receives a +4 circumstance bonus).

## Additional Details

At the end of this encounter, provided the PCs convince Dolom that they were trying to help and weren’t involved in the attack on the university provost, Dolom tells the party to go about its business.
