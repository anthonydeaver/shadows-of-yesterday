## Background

This adventure provides a conclusion to the search-forthe- schemas storyline that began in “The Forgotten Forge.” There are four schemas that combine with an ancient creation pattern to create an as yet unknown item of great power. House Cannith, with the help of the adventurers, has recovered the creation pattern and schemas A and B (if the adventurers successfully completed “The Forgotten Forge” and Shadows of the Last War). The Order of the Emerald Claw, which also covets the schemas, has acquired schema B (a copy from the facility at Whitehearth) and schema C. The last part, schema D, is still unaccounted for.

 

Lady Elaydren d’Cannith, working secretly for Baron Merrix d’Cannith, has served as the adventurers’ patron and has provided them with the means to recover two of the schemas and the creation pattern. She claims to represent Baron Jorlanna d’Cannith of Aundair, and does belong to the Aundairian house, but has long been secretly in the service of Merrix. Why the subterfuge? Because Merrix doesn’t want his competitors or opponents to know he is on the trail of ancient magic. Jorlanna wants the schemas? Fine. Merrix wants them? Then they must be powerful indeed. (At least, that’s how Merrix believes people interpret his actions.)

 

Garrow, a changeling priest of the Blood of Vol in the service of the Emerald Claw, leads that group’s efforts to recover the schemas and has been successful enough to acquire two of them. He appeared as a vampire in Shadows of the Last War and as a half-elf privateer and airship captain in Whispers of the Vampire’s Blade.

 

Finally, the Lord of Blades has also been searching for the schemas since he became aware of Provost Bonal Geldem’s work at Morgrave University. He has sent a number of agents to recover the schemas, but all have thus far failed him. Scimitar, who led an attack against the adventurers in Whispers of the Vampire’s Blade, continues to hunt for them or for their patron, Lady Elaydren.

## The Creation Pattern

Of the key players, only Merrix understands the truth of the creation pattern. He has studied the writings of his ancestor, Kedran d’Cannith, and knows a lot about the Maker’s long-ago forays into the mysterious wilderness of Xen’drik. Kedran, who lived around the time of the War of the Mark, constantly sought ways to improve his techniques and the power of his dragonmark. During his explorations and experiments, Kedran discovered one of the schemas that belonged to an ancient creation pattern that he dubbed “the Xulo Pattern.” He spent years deciphering writings dating back to the Age of Giants and searching for the other pieces of the Xulo Pattern. By the time he had found three of the four schemas and the creation pattern itself, Kedran realized the truth about the Xulo Pattern—it was disassembled and scattered across the Xen’drik wilderness on purpose.

 

Creation patterns discovered in Xen’drik appear in two sizes: large patterns used by giant wizards and smaller patterns employed by their elf magehands, the elves who were taught enough magic to assist their giant masters. The Xulo Pattern was one of the latter patterns. It converted arcane energy into sentience, which could then be imbued into items of all types—including constructs similar to the modern warforged. Over time, the Xulo Pattern developed sentience of its own. It was a dark, malevolent sentience that caused some amount of trouble for the giants. It took control of a temple and used its malign intelligence to sow discord and inflict pain. After a dreadful period of conflict instigated by the Xulo Pattern, the giants dismantled the pattern and hid each part (four schemas and the creation pattern itself) in a different location.

 

Over a number of years of dedicated study and exploration, Kedran recovered three of the schemas and the creation pattern. He studied them in his enclave in Sharn, piecing together purpose and history from the fragments of documents and tablets he uncovered in Xen’drik. On his last trip to the mysterious continent, Kedran not only located the fourth schema, he solved the secret of the Xulo Pattern. Realizing that the completed pattern would be dangerous, Kedran decided to leave the fourth schema where it was and returned to Sharn to separate the pieces he had. In isolation, each piece was a valuable tool for unlocking arcane secrets of the ancient giant civilization. By studying the individual schemas and the pattern from Xen’drik, Kedran and his descendants developed many creation patterns. Eventually, the warforged were created using the centuries of research and development started by Kedran long ago. 

 

Now, Baron Merrix d’Cannith wants to take the experiments to a level that Kedran refused to attain. Merrix wants to observe and study the completed Xulo Pattern, despite warnings from Kedran and the ancient Xen’drik arcane master. He wants to meet and converse with the ancient sentience, to learn what it can tell him about the Age of Giants, and to find new ways to improve his beloved creations—the warforged.
