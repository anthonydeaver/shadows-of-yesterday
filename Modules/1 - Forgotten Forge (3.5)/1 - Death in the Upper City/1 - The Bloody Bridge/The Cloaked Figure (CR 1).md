## Overview

During the battle with Cutter, the PCs can hear a few shouts from nearby towers: “Hey, stop that!” “Call the Watch!” “Murder! They’re murdering that man!” A few [[1. - Rounds|rounds]] later, the PCs hear the shrill whistle of [[2 - The City Watch (CR 5)|the City Watch]]—distant, but approaching.

If Cutter is disabled, destroyed, or rendered unconscious, her fi nal messenger separates from her torso. It unfolds fi ne wings and fl ies into the rain-soaked night. The adventurers don’t know it, but Cutter has passed on news of her failure to her superior, Saber, who is hiding elsewhere in the city.

When the warforged [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/classes/barbarian|barbarian]] falls, the PCs have a moment to more fully examine Bonal’s body and leather satchel. (Another shrill blare of a Watch whistle suggests that the law enforcers are fast approaching.)

The PCs have one round to examine the scene. Then Cutter climbs back over the railing nearest the body and attacks. She wants the satchel and its contents, but her berserker nature makes it hard for her to break off a battle once it has begun.

Cutter is part of a team of operatives sent to the City of Towers to locate Bonal Geldem, obtain his work concerning [[House Cannith]] activities in pre-Galifar [[Sharn]], and recover a long-lost schema. Cutter has been watching Bonal for days, and she believes that the key to the scholar’s work is in the leather satchel. She leaped at the old man, struck him down, and was about to grab the satchel when the adventurers arrived.

## Description

As the adventurers approach the scene of the crime, the cloaked fi gure who disappeared over the side of the skybridge works its way across the underside to [[2. - Surprise|surprise]] them. The fi gure beneath the cloak is a warforged named Cutter, a follower of the Lord of Blades. Like her leader, Cutter believes that the warforged shall rise up and overthrow the “weak-fl eshed” races. She bears the mark of [[Karrnath]] on her brow, though she abandoned that nation to join the Lord of Blades in [[The Mournland|the Mournland]]. Now, she has come to [[Sharn]] for a purpose.

**Skills:**: [[2 - Intimidation|Intimidation]] +4, [[5 - Survival|Survival]] +3

**Possessions: **: [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/items/battleaxe]]

**Traits:**: Immunity to [[Poison|poison]], [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/spells/sleep|sleep]] effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, fatigue, [[Exhaustion|exhaustion]], effects that cause the sickened condition, and energy drain.

## Tactics

As the warforged moves to attack, PCs who succeed on DC 15 Listen checks can notice the sounds of an approaching climber over the noise of the falling rain. Anyone who succeeds on this check can act during the [[2. - Surprise|surprise]] round. Everyone else is caught fl at-footed and unaware as the warforged leaps from beneath the bridge and attacks.

Cutter dives into combat with gusto, attacking the closest opponent. If she spots a warforged working with the adventurers, she turns her attention to the “fleshloving traitor.” If Cutter takes 4 points of damage, she goes into a rage. When raging, Cutter gains 2 hit points, her melee attack bonus increases to +5 (1d8+4/×3, [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/items/battleaxe|battleaxe]]), and her AC drops to 13. The rage lasts for 3 [[1. - Rounds|rounds]].

 When the rage ends, if Cutter is still functioning, she remembers her mission and moves to recover the leather satchel and fl ee.
