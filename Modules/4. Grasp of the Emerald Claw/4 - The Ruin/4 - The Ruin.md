# <center>4 - The Ruin</center>

## Overview

This portion of Grasp of the Emerald Claw allows the characters to explore one of the legendary ruins of the long-vanished giant civilization of Xen’drik. The imposing structure of this cyclopean ruin is composed of a ground “gallery” level, and three higher levels (the dark level, the temple level, and the observatory level). Hidden beneath the massive base of the cyclopean ruin is a secure vault level.

## Dungeon Features

*annotation:* Ruin Cutaway


The following features are accurate unless noted otherwise in a specifi c area description.

### The Ruin

The ruin is 325 feet tall, and composed of solid stone with lingering spells of solidity and protection. The gallery level is open to the elements, made of massive columns and blocks of stone that support the upper three levels. The dark level has no exterior access, but the temple and observatory levels have many windows and openings (DC 15 Strength check to reach, due to the overhang and the crumbling nature of the rock face). The hidden vault level is secret even to the creatures currently inhabiting the ruin.

### Doors

The doors that remain are sized for giants and show evidence that the lingering spells of protection have faded over the centuries; eroding stone and rusting iron are common. This defect makes the doors easier to break or force open than would otherwise be the case for such formidable doors. 

 

Giant doors are made of stone with iron hinges, 25 feet high, 15 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. They have , 360 hit points, and AC 5. Even pushing open these closed doors is a task, requiring a DC 12 Strength check.

### Ceiling Height

Except when noted otherwise (as in the gallery level), ceiling height within the ruin is 30 feet. Everything in the place is sized for giants, with a few exceptions that were made for the use of their elf slaves. The place should make the adventurers feel small, weak, and lost by comparison.

### Random Encounters

Creatures of all types still inhabit the ruin, as well as the forces of the Emerald Claw under the command of Garrow, and adventurers might run into them anywhere within the structure. For every 2 hours the PCs spend in a portion of the ruin other than the dark level or the vault level, roll d% and consult the following table. On any result of 51 or higher, no encounter occurs. On a roll of 01–50, read the result on the table and apply the suggested encounter.

## History

This structure served as a temple and arcane laboratory for a variety of giants during the height of the Age of Giants. In addition to giants, elf and drow slaves and magehands also occupied the place, serving their giant masters. 

 

Other than a few remaining hints, this information may be hard to impossible for the adventurers to learn, and in any case such details aren’t important for the purposes of this adventure.
