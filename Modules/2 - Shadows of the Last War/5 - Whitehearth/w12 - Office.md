## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

This corridor, accessed by a blue keycharm, leads to the offi ce once used by the ranking House Cannith representative at the facility. The everbright lantern in this room functions properly. The room appears to be a small library or study. Two sturdy oak desks are set against the left wall. The rest of the room is fi lled with shelves lined with scrolls and leather-bound books. On close examination, most of these items appear to be business ledgers: They are concerned with quantities of food purchased, receipts for bulk spell components, and similar kinds of information.

Â 

The corpse of a dead female clerk is slumped over the nearer of the two desks. Anyone who makes a DC 10 Perception check notices that she has collapsed on top of an especially ornate scroll.

## Rewards

The dead woman is lying on top of a scroll of Protection from Energy. She is also wearing a House Cannith signet ring.
