## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Outdoors

**Encounter Type**: Combat

This set-piece battle pits minions of the Emerald Claw against the PCs and the crew of Cloud’s Destiny. If the PCs didn’t get on the airship in Trolanport, use the “Need a Ride?” encounter to get them aboard the airship just in time for the big battle. Otherwise, the PCs don’t catch up with Cloud’s Destiny until after the airship has crashed. In that case, skip this encounter and go to "Travel by Lightening Rail".

**Light**: Night; everbright lanterns on the airships and skiffs provide bright illumination in some areas.

**Sound**: The PCs can automatically hear the fi ery rumble of the elementals bound to the airships.

**Reaction**: Once the crew becomes aware of the attack on Cloud’s Destiny, they rush to defend the airship.

## Setup

This encounter takes place in the sky to the west of Sterngate, near the Zilargo–Breland border. When Garrow’s airship, Jade’s Fury, pulls close to Cloud’s Destiny, he opens the lower hull hatches and releases four skiffs full of soldiers of the Emerald Claw. The Order of the Emerald Claw wants Lucan and the soul blade, and Garrow will do almost anything to accomplish this mission for his masters.

## Challenge

When you are ready to launch into this battle, read:

Three air-skiffs bear down on Cloud’s Destiny. These small, eight-person vessels are made of soarwood but don’t have bound elementals to provide speed. They are basically short-range craft. In the distance, you can see the large airship that carried the skiffs. A fourth skiff keeps its distance, its occupants firing arrows at the House Lyrandar crew. Just then a deck hand cries out, “Sky raiders to starboard, Captain!” The captain emerges from his quarters. “Battle stations, everyone!” he bellows, “Passengers get below decks!”

This complex battle involves lots of NPCs, but you don’t need to worry about most of them. Stay focused on the PCs and the action occurring around them. Every so often, let them know how the rest of the battle is going, dramatically describing the death of one crewmember or the heroic actions of another. 

 

The three skiffs swoop in and disgorge Emerald Claw soldiers onto the upper deck of Cloud’s Destiny, at the locations marked on the map. The soldiers on the fourth skiff fi re their bows at range, focusing on uniformed crewmembers until someone starts shooting back at them. 

 

The PCs have to deal with the soldiers in the three boarding parties, the archers in the fourth skiff, the panicked passengers aboard their airship, and the mounting casualties among the airship’s crew. As DM, you have an extensive menu of interesting challenges you can throw at the PCs. Pace the battle so that the PCs are always on the verge of being overwhelmed, but the situation isn’t totally hopeless. These various challenges are detailed below.

### Jade's Fury

The large airship remains close to the battle but never engages in direct combat. Garrow leads his troops from aboard the airship, staying close in case his direct intervention becomes necessary. At the end of this scene, depending on how the boarding action turns out, Garrow uses Jade’s Fury as a battering ram to disable the House Lyrandar airship.

### Boarding Parties

Three skiffs pull alongside Cloud’s Destiny and board the vessel at the spots marked on the map. Each skiff contains six Emerald Claw soldiers and two skiff crewmembers that remain on their crafts. The soldiers in the boarding parties slay anyone in their path as they search for Lucan and the soul blade. Each six-member boarding party contains fi ve soldiers and a leader.

Boarding Party Tactics: The fi rst group to board the airship engages as many people on deck as possible, preferring to attack uniformed crewmembers. The second group heads belowdecks as soon as they can. The third group attacks anyone they can fi nd on the aft superstructure of the vessel. 

 

After the soldiers board the airship, the skiffs that carried them move off and return to Jade’s Fury. Garrow might send them back to collect the soldiers, depending on the outcome of the battle.

 

The soldiers have a description of Lucan, and they know he’s a vampire. They have orders to capture Lucan if possible, but the Order of the Emerald Claw is more interested in the soul blade than in the intelligence it can gain from the former Citadel agent. 

 

Against all others aboard the airship, the Emerald Claw soldiers simply attack with their fl ails, taking the time to make coup de grace attacks against fallen foes because Garrow’s orders ended with a terse “No witnesses.” If any Emerald Claw soldiers reach the elemental chamber, they attempt to free the bound elemental in order to disable the vessel. 

 

Badly wounded or outmatched Emerald Claw soldiers retreat to the main deck of the airship, hoping that the skiffs will return to rescue them.

### Skiff Archers

Six archers and two crewmembers are aboard the fourth skiff. It maintains a distance of 30 feet from Cloud’s Destiny, circling the airship. The archers fire at those aboard the airship, targeting crewmembers wearing the colors of House Lyrandar. If the opportunity presents itself, an archer takes a shot at one of the PCs engaged in combat with the Emerald Claw soldiers. Once the archers use up all their arrows, the skiff returns to Jade’s Fury.

### On Cloud's Destiny

Since this attack occurs at night, none of the other passengers are on deck for the fi ght. The passengers do panic, however, and make a lot of noise belowdecks. If the Emerald Claw soldiers move belowdecks to search for Lucan, they have no qualms about slaughtering any passengers that can’t or won’t get out of their way.

Airship Crew Tactics: The airship crew repels the boarders as well as they can, but don’t play out their attacks unless they have an immediate impact on something a PC is doing. If the PCs weren’t there, the airship crew would fi ght bravely but would soon succumb to the boarders and the ranged attacks from the skiffs. You might never make a roll for a member of the airship crew. But if one of the PCs is sorely pressed, a small cluster of crewmembers might provide suffi cient distraction to give the PC an escape route or enough respite to quaff a potion or cast a spell.

Captain Morgis Tactics: Captain Morgis loves his airship like nothing else in the world, and he stops at nothing to repel boarders from it. Heedless of personal danger, he charges headlong into battle against the Emerald Claw soldiers. (While this isn’t the smartest plan, it does make the crash landing in the next encounter more likely if Morgis is wounded or killed.) Only if the PCs restrain him will Morgis forego making melee attacks against the invaders.

Lucan and Grilsha Tactics: Grilsha waits a few rounds before dropping her disguise and laying into the Emerald Claw soldiers or the PCs—whoever is closer. Lucan doesn’t emerge from his hiding place until near the end of the battle, either as the airship plummets from the sky or after it crashes in the next scene.

## Rewards

This encounter works best if you provide a steady stream of opponents for the PCs to deal with while describing the larger battle in evocative but general terms. Unlike most fi ghts, this one may go on for dozens of rounds. That’s okay, although you should give the PCs occasional lapses in opponents lasting a round or two so that they can heal, plan their next move, and so on. Here’s one way it might play out. The PCs defeat Emerald Claw soldiers on the deck in four rounds, then trade shots with the skiff-board archers for a few rounds. Then they hunker down for a round or two before heading belowdecks to root out Emerald Claw soldiers and save the passengers. Here are some techniques the PCs might try during this encounter.

### Commandeer a Skiff

The skiff crewmembers are no match for the PCs, but they know this and won’t bring the skiffs closer than 30 feet from the upper deck of the airship. To commandeer a skiff, the PCs have to use magic to entice the skiff crew closer, or employ [[fly|Fly]], [[jump|Jump]], or [[Dimension Door|dimension door]] to get over to the skiff. 

 

Once the PCs have reached a skiff and eliminated resistance from the crew, it takes a move action and a DC 10 Intelligence check to operate the skiff. A successful check lets a character turn the skiff up to 90 degrees per round, move it up to 150 feet straight ahead, or have it ascend or descend by up to 50 feet.

### Push a Foe off the Deck

A bull rush attempt suffi ces to push someone off the airship’s upper deck. The presence of the rail around the upper deck gives the defender a +2 bonus on the opposed check to avoid being bull rushed. Characters who start falling have 3 rounds to save themselves, usually by casting a spell, before they hit the ground and take 20d6 points of damage.

### Shoot a Ballista

The airships have autoloading mechanisms attached to the ballistas. This feature doesn’t make reloading a ballista completely automatic, but it does speed the process. It takes a full-round action to reload one of an airship’s three ballistas. The weapons otherwise function as described on page 100 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

### Fly the Airship

It takes a move action and a successful DC 15 Intelligance check to operate the airship. A successful check made lets the character turn the airship up to 45 degrees per round, move it up to 200 feet straight ahead, or have it ascend or descend by up to 50 feet. This won’t work for more than a round or two, because the bound fire elemental that provides lift and thrust for the airship resists orders from anyone without a House Lyrandar dragonmark.
