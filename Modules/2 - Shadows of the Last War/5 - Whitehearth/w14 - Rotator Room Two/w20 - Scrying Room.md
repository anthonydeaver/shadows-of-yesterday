# <center>w20 - Scrying Room</center>

## Overview

**Type**: Room

This is another chamber of illusionsâ€”one that provides the PCs with a warning about the fi nal challenge they must face to claim the schema. When the characters enter this area, they experience an illusion as though they had entered area W22. It takes a moment to realize there is no sensation of heat or smell of fl ame. This room functions as an enormous [[Crystal ball|crystal ball]] set to scry on area W22. If a character makes a DC 18 Spot check while watching the scene, he or she notices a chest containing the schema and two vials marked with a symbol that looks like a flame. A DC 5 [[1 - Arcana|Arcana]] check reveals that this symbol indicates that the vials contain potions of [[resistance|Resistance]].

## Rewards

A quick examination of the room, and a DC 15 [[3 - Investigation|Investigation]] check, uncovers a red [[Keycharm|keycharm]] hanging from a hook on the wall.
