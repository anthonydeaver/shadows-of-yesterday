# <center>2 - Aboard Cloud's Destiny</center>

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Outdoors

**Encounter Type**: Roleplaying

If the PCs make it aboard Cloud’s Destiny before it pulls away from the docking tower, they next must convince the ship’s captain that they are paying passengers (see “Paying the Fare,” below). Once that detail is taken care of, they can try to locate Lucan (and Grilsha, if she’s still traveling with her brother).

## Setup

Lucan and Grilsha (the rest of this encounter is written presuming that she is still aiding her brother; adjust accordingly if she has fallen out of the adventure at this point) arrived aboard Cloud’s Destiny a half-hour to an hour ahead of the PCs. Lucan dominated the gnomes on the dock, then presented himself to the ship’s captain, utilizing the traveling papers and the code word provided by Neya. Then Lucan dominated the captain, getting him to provide Lucan with a secure hiding place and then ordering him to forget that he had such a hiding place. Lucan also made the captain forget that they had ever met.

The Hiding Place: The hiding place is the equivalent of a huge bag of holding. A locker on the cargo deck provides access to the nondimensional space where House Lyrandar can store cargo it would rather not have to pass through customs at any port of call. The locker is larger on the inside than on the outside, able to hold 15,000 pounds and a volume of up to 2,500 cubic feet. Object and creatures within the locker cannot be detected, so spells such as locate object or detect undead won’t turn up either the soul blade or Lucan once they are inside and the locker is closed. An amazing lock (Open Lock DC 40) protects the door; Lucan took the only key from the captain. In addition, the locker’s door and sides are made of iron (hardness 10, 60 hp, break DC 28). 

 

Grilsha, meanwhile, disguises herself as a middleaged human woman with the aid of a disguise self spell. She has a Disguise modifi er of +11, and attempts to avoid unnecessary contact with either the crew or the other passengers.

## Paying the Fare

The PCs board Cloud’s Destiny without letters of passage or authorized traveling papers. The papers provided to them by Viorr can help, and the letter of credit can be used to pay their fare, but they still have to deal with an unsympathetic captain.

Captain Morgis, a tough half-elf with a gruff personality, demands to know what the characters think they’re doing leaping onto his ship without letter of passage or permission. Morgis has no orders from Lucan concerning the PCs; the vampire didn’t have time to cover every contingency with the half-elf captain. Still, Morgis has an unfriendly attitude toward the PCs, and it takes a DC 25 Persuasion check to convince him not to throw them overboard. (The PCs can get a +1 bonus for every 250 gp they add as a bribe to get on the captain’s good side. The letter of credit can’t be used in this fashion; the PCs must use their own money.)

## Searching the Airship

Cloud’s Destiny’s captain and crew won’t let the PCs search the airship from top to bottom. The characters have to invent a clever ruse—probably accompanied by charm spells, Bluff checks, and other tricks—to look into guest quarters and nonpublic parts of the airship.

An interesting cat-and-mouse game can develop, with the PCs searching for Lucan and Grilsha. Lucan won’t emerge from the nondimensional cargo hold inside the locker, but the characters can encounter Grilsha (if she’s still present) over the course of the trip. 

 

None of the other passengers or crew knows anything about Lucan, who came aboard the ship in disguise and immediately went to deal with the captain. If the PCs try to alarm the captain by revealing that Lucan is a vampire (provided they’ve fi gured that out by now), Captain Morgis doesn’t blink. “As long as he’s paid his fare and isn’t feasting on my crew, what do I care what type of creature he is?” Morgis declares. 

 

Continue the search of the airship for as long as it’s fun for everyone at the table. Whenever you want, just say that time passes. About twenty-fi ve hours after the airship leaves Trolanport, an attack occurs. Go to “Sky Raiders to Starboard!,” below.
