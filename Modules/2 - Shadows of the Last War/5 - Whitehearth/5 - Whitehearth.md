# <center>5 - Whitehearth</center>

## Overview

The magewrights, artifi cers, and wizards of the Whitehearth facility were not the architects of the Mournland, and the cause of the devastation remains a mystery. House Cannith was selling magic weapons to all fi ve of the great nations, and Whitehearth was where the house developed spells and items considered to be too dangerous or volatile to test near civilization. On the Day of Mourning, the energies that created the Mournland swept across Whitehearth. Many of the researchers and support staff were killed instantly. They were the lucky ones—others were destroyed by arcane experiments thrown out of control. Now chaos and death fi ll the halls of Whitehearth. House Cannith has sent a few teams to investigate the place over the intervening four years, but none have returned.

This section of Shadows of the Last War is a traditional dungeon crawl. The adventurers must overcome mystically altered beasts, living spells, and arcane traps while searching for the schema and information concerning the creation pattern it ties to.

Whitehearth was carved out of the stone using powerful magic. Unless otherwise noted, assume the following conditions to be true:

 

- Walls are smooth gray stone (15 hp/inch of thickness, generally 1 foot thick between rooms), and ceilings are 8 feet high. 
- Everbright lanterns once lit the workshops, but the mystical shock wave overloaded the lanterns, and now they only give off a dim radiance equivalent to shadowy illumination. 
- Standard doors are made from three inches of steel (90 hp, break DC 15) and sealed with [[Arcane Lock|arcane lock]] (raising the break DC to 25). These locks are tied to color-coded keycharms. When the proper charm is pressed into a socket next to the door, the portal is unlocked.
- A permanent Mordenkainen’s private sanctum spell protects the entire complex, making it hard to locate by magical means.

## Rotator Rooms

Three rotator rooms separate the different sections of the Whitehearth facility. Each rotator room is a hollow steel sphere approximately 20 feet across with a single entryway. Various corridors lead to a rotator room, but the entryway only lines up with one corridor at a time.

To rotate the sphere and realign an entryway, a character must manipulate the control panel located at the center of each room. The panel features a set of color-coded sockets. If a character uses the appropriate color-coded keycharm, the room rotates to line up the entryway with the corridor that corresponds to the colored socket. Any corridor that leads to the rotator room has a panel set in its wall so that the sphere can be accessed from the outside.

The walls of the rotator rooms have been alchemically and magically treated to make them extremely durable (hardness 10, 1,800 hp), since these served as the primary security and safety measures employed by the facility.
